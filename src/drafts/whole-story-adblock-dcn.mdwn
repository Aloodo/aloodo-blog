Covering the "adblock wars" (as [Doc Searls calls the
situation](https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/24/the-adblock-war-series/))
is hard.  It's like showing up at a peaceful protest
where organized looters show up and mix with the
protesters.

 * If you're reporting on the event and you quote some protesters without mentioning looting that you know about, then you missed half the story by ignoring what the store owners could have told you.

 * If you cover the looting but not whatever the peaceful protesters are saying, then you missed the opportunity to find out anything about the issue behind the protest.

It's hard to read about ad blocking without
seeing just one side of a complicated
story.  On one side, web ads have a [malware
problem](http://www.somethingawful.com/news/adblocker-nag-screens/),
and a [fraud
problem](liveramp.com/blog/how-ad-fraud-impacts-your-measurement-with-dr-augustine-fou/),
and the long-running paradox
of why the [most targetable ad
media are the least valuable and the most
blocked](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/).
Web ads clearly need some serious help.
For users, running a wide-open browser that leaks
personal data and accepts risky scripts is not a
realistic option.  Some kind of protection tool under
the user's control is good for users, and for brands
and publishers that depend on [reputation-driven
advertising](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/tv-shopping-with-rory-sutherland/).

But we can't lump looters in with reformers, or we
start fooling ourselves on real problems in the ad
blocking scene, the same way that adtech proponents
keep fooling themselves on malvertising and fraud.
Even in the browser's built-in help, users aren't
getting the facts they need.

**Are users getting the truth about Adblock Plus?**

One web browser's built-in info, the source of
the box shown above, makes Adblock Plus look
pretty harmless. It's labeled as the work
of an individual&mdash;but it's a corporate
project. If you look at the actual code, it's
labeled `"Copyright (C) 2006-2016 Eyeo GmbH"`.
That's not the tricky part, though.  This description says that Adblock
Plus "can" mitigate tracking and malware.  But if you
actually flip that cute little switch
thingy, you automatically get the "Acceptable Ads"
[paid](https://www.engadget.com/2016/02/12/rip-adblock-plus/)
[whitelisting](http://www.businessinsider.com/criteo-pays-adblock-plus-to-appear-on-its-acceptable-ads-whitelist-2015-12)
program, which enforces no standards on tracking or
security at all. In order to get the protection
claimed, you have to both add an "EasyPrivacy" filter
list subscription, and turn off "Acceptable Ads"
with a confusingly named "Allow some non-intrusive
advertising" checkbox.  If "Acceptable Ads" is left on,
it overrides the EasyPrivacy subscription, which is not
clear from the UI.  If Facebook or some other
user-tracking site had this level of transparency,
users would be starting petitions.

This paid whitelisting isn't just
["controversial"](http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2016/08/26/its-people-vs-abuse-not-publishers-vs-adblockerss/).
It's actively wrong by any standard but the
Silicon Valley "anything for network effects
lol" standard.  It is one of the four [problematic
practices](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/code-of-conduct/)
covered in a recent
[complaint from the Newspaper Association of
America](http://test.naa.org/~/media/NAACorp/Public%20Files/PublicPolicy/GovernmentAffairs/NAA%20FTC%20Complaint_5-25-16.pdf)
(PDF) to the US Federal Trade Commission.

> [A]s a review of the practices of ad-blocking companies discloses, consumers do not “opt out” of an ecosystem by using ad-blockers.  Instead, they “opt in” to a deceptive new environment that does not adequately disclose its practices to consumers.

Adblock Plus has raised quite a
[brouhaha](https://adblockplus.org/blog/new-acceptable-ads-platform-launches-bringing-feedback-to-rtb-and-help-to-small-websites)
among surprised users, with the company's
recent announcement that it was going into the
targeted advertising business.  The plan [was
a surprise to unaware "partners" Google and AppNexus,
too](http://www.businessinsider.com/appnexus-google-refute-adblock-plus-partnership-2016-9).
But whether or not Adblock Plus is really an ad
network now, the company still participates in the
web advertising market as an intermediary, creating
trouble for legit web sites.  And ultimately the
"adblock wars" will be won or lost based on choices
made at those sites.  The people who work hard to
put news and cultural works on the web will have to
decide what to do about ad blocking.  Web publishers
are in a double crisis right now.

 * **Adblocking:** costs both publishers and
   intermediaries.

 * **Adfraud:** is a wash for adtech, agencies, and
    advertisers, because [costs are passed on to
    publishers](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/thank-you-for-supporting-fraud/).


Intermediaries can afford to hand-wave
on the fraud problem, [tell brand
advertisers to go hire a security expert
somewhere](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/learn-to-hack/),
and concentrate on blocking.
Publishers, who [bear the real costs of
adfraud](blog.aloodo.org/posts/thank-you-for-supporting-fraud/),
can't.

The good news is that promising solutions
are already out there.  The ["reinvention not
reinsertion"](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/reinvention-not-reinsertion/)
concept, from Dr. Johnny Ryan at Pagefair, is a good
example.  Better privacy protection for a smaller
number of higher-quality ads helps make them resistant
to both blocking and fraud.

Privacy tool developers and publishers share
interests, but in order to understand what we have
in common, we must communicate clearly about the
difference between, on one side, legit user concerns
and the tools that address them, and on the other,
the publisher-hostile paid whitelisting racket.  If we
want to make a reasonable case for next-generation
advertising, it has to work for the people who write,
shoot, edit, and publish our news and cultural works.
That starts with telling the whole story.
