Congratulations to EFF and the Privacy Badger
team on their [1.0
release!](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/privacy-badger-10-blocks-sneakiest-kinds-online-tracking)

> More than a quarter of a million users have already
> installed the alpha and beta releases of Privacy
> Badger. The new Privacy Badger 1.0 includes blocking
> of certain kinds of super-cookies and browser
> fingerprintingâ€”the latest ways that some parts of the
> online tracking industry try to follow Internet users
> from site to site.

Remember that a conventional ad blocker
may not protect you from web tracking (and
the fraud and malware that tracking enables).
Firefox and Chrome users, [install Privacy Badger
now](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger), get
protected, and help your favorite web sites at the
same time.
