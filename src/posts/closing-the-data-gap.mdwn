Good goal.  That is where we're going to have
to get to in order to save the ad-supported web.
Yes, the current web ad system is a dumpster fire.
It's no secret that adtech intermediaries can
leak user data from high-reputation sites to
low-reputation ones.  Right now the web is a
[good match for advertisers that want to do
targeting-based, low-reputation strategies,
but terrible for signaling-based, high-reputation
strategies](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/tv-shopping-with-rory-sutherland/).
Third-party tracking is a bad deal
for publishers, too. For example,
[chumboxes](https://theawl.com/a-complete-taxonomy-of-internet-chum-de0b7a070a2d)
are currently good for quick cash, but can leak
user data and motivate users to install ad blockers.


## TrustX: a better way, or same broken system with new owners?

(I have contributed [several
items to the Digital Content Next
blog](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/author/don-marti/).)

Jack Marshall at the _Wall Street Journal_ reports that
[Digital Content Next is launching a new ad marketplace
called TrustX](https://twitter.com/JackMarshall/status/780210395449483264).

> With no outside investors and no profit motives, TrustX will focus on driving long-term benefits to marketers and publishers, DCN said.

Are publishers just getting a piece of a low-value ad
system, or really changing things?  

Here's how we'll be able to know.

**Who is in the tracking-protected audience?**
Tracking protection is fundamental to web
publisher value.  From the high-reputation
publisher's point of view, DNT is more like "Do
not leak data" or "Do not commoditize."  But it's
hard to measure accurately, because there are
many different kinds.  What works for detecting [AVG
Crumble](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crumble-%E2%80%93-online-privacy/icpfjjckgkocbkkdaodapelofhgjncoh?hl=en)
might not work to detect [Privacy
Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger).
Any project to fix web ads depends on getting good
numbers on site audiences that are protected from
third-party tracking, and so harder to track from
high-value to low-value sites. ([You can do this with 
the Aloodo un-tracking pixel and
scripts](http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/howto/).)


**What does the market for competing low-value ads
look like?** Who else is selling impressions that
claim to reach the TrustX audience?  Get on one or
more DSPs and buy some.  Right now, conventional
adtech can make a lot of bold claims about quality.
(Ever notice that web ad impressions overall are
about 30% bots, but every individual adtech company
claims 2% bots?  Somebody's math is wrong.)  Buy the
cheapest impressions that claim to be "your audience"
that you can, and check them out.  Part of that is
comparing their tracking protection rates.  If you
have an early adopter audience that's well-protected,
then a competing site that's full of bots will really
stand out.

**How can publishers refine the data-driven case for 
Flight to Quality?**
[Real, high-quality sites have
branding advantages over generic
eyeball-buying](http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2016/The-Halo-Effect-How-Advertising-on-Premium-Publishers-Drives-Higher-Ad-Effectiveness),
and [adfraud is becoming a mainstream
concern](http://www.wsj.com/articles/doubts-about-digital-ads-rise-over-new-revelations-1474674323).  The complex adtech that tracking protection protects
against is also the place where fraud hides.
But conventional adtech has a lead in
data collection.  Higher-reputation publishers need
more and better data to take to numbers-craving CMOs.
Much of that data will have to come from the
tracking-protected audience.


## This thing could really work.

If TrustX can do things right&mdash;CNAME support and
[EFF-flavored DNT](https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy)
would be solid choices&mdash;then ad blockers start
to be less of a concern.  Legit publishers can deal
with the ad blocker the same way that MailChimp
deals with the spam filter.  Accept that it's there,
carefully get around it, and comply with user norms.
It would be counterproductive for MailChimp to
get email newsletter subscribers to turn off the
spam filter entirely, but they can get their own
newsletters through without paying anybody off.

Facebook showed that you can beat the pattern-matching
of Adblock Plus with fairly simple HTML changes.
If TrustX can keep the privacy developers
on the sidelines by respecting DNT, then that gives
high-reputation sites some options. Refuse to pay
into the "Acceptable Ads" racket, do some careful
adblocker workarounds, [advocate responsible tracking
protection](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2016/04/27/service-journalism-and-the-web-advertising-problem/),
and keep the [four-currency
price](http://www.fortressofdoors.com/ad-blockers-and-the-four-currencies/)
of accepting magazine-style ads on the web lower than the
four-currency price of blocking them.
