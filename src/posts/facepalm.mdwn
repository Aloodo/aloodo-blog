Want to get a little more info on the brand-unsafe ad problem?
Two minutes, easy experiment.

 * Get a fresh browser, not one you normally use.
If you're on Safari or Chrome, try this in Firefox, or
vice versa.  (Don't pick a browser such as Brave that
has a built-in ad blocker.  This is about the ads.)

 * Go to your favorite&mdash;or least favorite&mdash;jihadi, white nationalist, or shitlord site.

 * Look at the ads.

That's the kind of thing I get based on the above
site's ability to get ads based on its content.
Crappy ads from advertisers that will settle for any
impression, anywhere, whether brand-safe or not.

I don't see any reputable brands showing up when
I do this with a fresh browser.  How about you?
[LMK on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dmarti/) which
seems to be the place to talk about this stuff.

So why is the [Sleeping Giants
campaign](https://twitter.com/slpng_giants) even
a thing?  Why are people finding real brand ads on
brand-unsafe sites?

The problem is that browsers have old bugs, some left
over from the 1990s browser wars, that let information
leak from one site to another.  "Your ad on a site
we know is crap" is pretty much worthless to an ad
agency, but they will pay for "your ad to a known
user" and pretend the brand safety issues don't exist.

But putting brand safety last, and trying to hack
around it when people complain, can't work when the
other side just has better hackers.

Here's the most facepalm-worthy but also totally
accurate 2017 web advertising prediction so far:

Really?  A brand-new service rushed out the door,
by companies that never cared about shitlords
before, is going to have a chance?  When shitlords
consistently have better skills, and out-hack
the entire Lumascape, without even mussing their
["dapper"](http://www.salon.com/2016/12/03/dapper-and-dangerous-the-ugly-history-of-glamorizing-white-nationalism/)
outfits?  Good luck with that.

Maybe there's a better way. Brands, legit
sites, and users can stop playing a losing
game, and it starts with a [few lines of
