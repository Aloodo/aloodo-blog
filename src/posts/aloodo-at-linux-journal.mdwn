Doc Searls [writes, at Linux
Journal,](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/help-us-cure-online-publishing-its-addiction-personal-data)
about the site's re-launch plans.  Linux Journal is
moving to an all-subscription model.

> We believe the only cure is code that gives publishers ways to do exactly what readers want, which is not to bare their necks to adtech's fangs every time they visit a website.

> We're doing that by reversing the way terms of use work. Instead of readers always agreeing to publishers' terms, publishers will agree to readers' terms.

The Linux audience tends to be early adopters of
privacy tools, which means that brands need new kinds
of metrics.  When you're trying to reach niche early
adopters such as the open source and devops audiences
that <cite>Linux Journal</cite> serves, conventional
adtech and martech aren't enough.

The readers of <cite>Linux Journal</cite> have
overwhelmingly rejected web advertising. This
is strange, because as a former editor there
back when they had a print magazine, I recall
that readers didn't have much of a problem with
the print ads.  We got the usual bragging that
<q>ads don't work on me,</q> but [print ads don't
work the way that most people think they work
anyway](https://www.meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/).

The <cite>Linux Journal</cite> ads got crappy when they
went web-only.  Instead of a sustainable revenue
source, the ad game became a race to the bottom.
And [LJ almost lost that
game](https://blog.zgp.org/purple-box-claims-another-victim/).

The good news is that the game is
changing because of hard work happening
on the browser side.  Every time a user
turns on a privacy feature such as [Firefox Tracking
Protection](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tracking-protection#w_how-to-turn-tracking-protection-on),
or installs a protection tool such as [Better
by ind.ie](https://ind.ie/) or [EFF Privacy
Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger), a
little bit of problematic ad inventory goes away.
When tracking protection tools keep ad money out
of the nasty corners of the internet, legit sites
can win.  Here's how Aloodo plans to help LJ, and is
available to help other sites too.

**Measure the tracking-protected audience.** Tracking
protection is a powerful sign of a human audience. A
legit site can report a tracking protection percentage
for its audience, and any adtech intermediary who
claims to offer advertisers the same audience,
but delivers a suspiciously low tracking protection
number, is clearly pushing a mismatched or bot-heavy
audience and is going to have a harder time getting
away with it.  Showing prospective advertisers your
tracking protection data lets you reveal the tarnish
on the adtech "Holy Grail"&mdash;the promise of
high-value eyeballs on crappy sites.

Tracking protection is hard to
measure accurately, because there are
many different kinds.  What works for detecting [AVG
Crumble](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crumble-%E2%80%93-online-privacy/icpfjjckgkocbkkdaodapelofhgjncoh?hl=en)
might not work to detect [Privacy
Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger).
[But now anyone with basic web metrics and
JavaScript skills can do the measurement
with the Aloodo un-tracking pixel and
scripts](http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/howto/).

**Use data to sell brands on Flight
to Quality.** [Real, high-quality
sites have branding advantages over generic
eyeball-buying](http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2016/The-Halo-Effect-How-Advertising-on-Premium-Publishers-Drives-Higher-Ad-Effectiveness),
and [adfraud is becoming a mainstream
concern](http://www.wsj.com/articles/doubts-about-digital-ads-rise-over-new-revelations-1474674323).
The complex adtech that tracking protection protects
against is also the place where fraud hides.  (Adtech
also tends to [drag brands into Internet poo-flinging
contests by attaching them to controversial
sites](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/business/media/breitbart-vanguard-ads-follow-users-target-marketing.html),
but that's another story.)

Higher-reputation publishers need
more and better data to take to numbers-craving CMOs.
Much of that data will have to come from the
tracking-protected audience.  When quality sites
share tracking protection data with advertisers, 
that helps expose the [adfraud that intermediaries 
have no incentive to track
down](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/thank-you-for-supporting-fraud/).

We look forward to working with <cite>Linux
Journal<cite> and the LJ readers.
