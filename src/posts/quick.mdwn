Tracking protection is still hard to measure
accurately, because there are many different
kinds.  The Aloodo project can pick up everything,
including lesser-known vintage tools such as [AVG
Crumble](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crumble-%E2%80%93-online-privacy/icpfjjckgkocbkkdaodapelofhgjncoh?hl=en)
and even behavior-based tools like [Privacy
Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) that take
a while to get <q>trained</q> and start blocking.

The biggest protection tools are the browser
built-ins.  Apple Safari has had Intelligent Tracking
Prevention, and Mozilla Firefox is testing Enhanced
Tracking Protection.  We have added a quick test that
should cover both of these.  Now there is an
`onBlocked` callback to take action when we can detect
right away that a user has this form of protection
because a third-party cookie won't persist.
