Some sites recommend Adblock Plus (or
just "an ad blocker," for which Adblock
Plus is often the first search result)
as a privacy or security tool.  But [Adblock
Plus](https://www.engadget.com/2016/02/12/rip-adblock-plus/)
uses deceptive "[dark
patterns](https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern)"
to avoid offering real privacy or security to users.

**Please do not recommend either Adblock Plus or
"an ad blocker" to users who are concerned about web
privacy or security.**

Adblock Plus runs a [paid
whitelisting program called "Acceptable
Ads"](http://www.businessinsider.com/criteo-pays-adblock-plus-to-appear-on-its-acceptable-ads-whitelist-2015-12).
The "Acceptable" criteria include no rules against
common user privacy and security concerns, such
as malvertising and PII misuse.  And configuring
Adblock Plus to actually provide tracking protection
is complicated.

 * Go to "Filter Preferences" in the ABP menu.

 * Click "Add filter subscription"

 * No privacy lists appear on the main drop-down.  You will have to hunt for them behind "Add a different subscription".

 * Scroll down and eventually find the "EasyPrivacy" entry from a long list.

 * Click "Add subscription".

So far, it's time-consuming and deliberately
complicated, but not deceptive.  (Keep this in mind
when Adblock Plus proponents talk about how users
are mad about annoying ads but don't mind tracking.
If users don't mind tracking, why did Adblock Plus
make it so hard to make the choice?)

Turning on a privacy list is enough of a maze to
discourage users, but not _deceptive_ deceptive.
That's found in another place.


## Now for the deceptive part.

Even after you go through the above
five-step (!) process to find and
turn on "EasyPrivacy", you're still not
protected. This is not clear unless you read the
fine print.  The ["Acceptable Ads" paid whitelisting
program](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/25/adblock-plus-opens-up-acceptable-ads-work)
actually _overrides_ your explicit EasyPrivacy
choice, to allow tracking by Google, Criteo, and
other companies.

In order to make your tracking protection choice take
effect, you also have to turn off "Acceptable Ads"
using a different option, which is labeled "Allow
some non-intrusive advertising."

**To really block trackers, un-check a box with a
label that says nothing about trackers at all.**

The checkbox is not even labeled "Acceptable
Ads," maybe just in case a user has heard
of "Acceptable Ads" and knows about
the [controversial paid whitelisting
program](https://pagefair.com/blog/2017/eyeos-toothless-acceptable-ads-committee/).


## What to do instead

The good news is that alternatives are available.

 * Instead of recommending "an ad blocker," link to
   a list of legit [tracking protection
   tools](https://www.aloodo.org/protection/),
   or make your own list of tools that
   work well with your site.  It's easy to
   use a JavaScript browser detector like
   [bowser](https://github.com/lancedikson/bowser)
   to recommend an appropriate one for the user.

 * If you maintain a directory of web software,
   please do not list Adblock Plus in a privacy or
   security category.
