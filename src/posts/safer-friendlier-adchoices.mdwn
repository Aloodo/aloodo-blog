A lot of web sites have a link to
[AdChoices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdChoices).
Tried it lately?  Probably not.  The <a rel="nofollow"
href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Opt Out</a>
page is designed to appease regulators, not to help
users.  AdChoices only opts out of some companies'
tracking systems, so there is no way for a user to
know, even after completing the opt-out process, whether
he or she is opted out of all tracking on the site he or
she came in from.  AdChoices also prompts users to make
a questionable change to the browser configuration:
turning on third-party cookies.
Just to make a bad UX story worse, the [AdChoices
malware](http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Adchoices)
is using the same name and logo now.

AdChoices is a slower,
less effective, and more fragile <q>choice</q> than an
ad blocker. If a user wasn't interested in ad blocking
before, a visit to AdChoices will probably do it.

## Giving users an alternative to ad blocking

Because of ongoing
[malvertising](/posts/end-user-security/)
risks, running an ad blocker has been an
understandable choice for users for quite
a while.  But that's changing.
The new generation of [tracking
protection](http://www.aloodo.org/protection/)
is easier then turning on tracking protection
in a general-purpose ad blocker, and way easier than
AdChoices.  Most important, though, tracking protection
is a [net win](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#solution-tracking-protection)
for sites and brands, unlike <q
class="scare">dumb</q> blockers.

Getting users to adopt tracking protection is
important for all ad-supported sites. We all want to
see sustainable budgets for publishers, and lower data
leakage and fraud.  But not all tracking protection
works for all browsers.  One option for sites is to
detect the browser and link to an appropriate tracking
protection tool or configuration instructions.
([Bowser](https://github.com/ded/bowser/) is a good
way to do this, if you're up for some coding.)

Less confusing, though, to alert vulnerable users and offer
a [tracking test](http://www.aloodo.org/test/).
That can be more complicated, since it involves
setting up multiple domains, getting tracking
protection listings, and more.

To keep it simple, Aloodo does it all for you.
Sites can now use our tools, in place of that confusing
AdChoices link, to alert the users who are most
vulnerable to third-party tracking.  Drop in an
element with an id of `tracking-warning-inline` and
display set to `none`.

	<a id="tracking-warning-inline"
	 href="http://www.aloodo.org/protection/"
	 style="display: none;">Third
	party tracking detected. Please install
	tracking protection.</a>

	This site uses third-party trackers, which
	you have the option to turn off.

	<a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.aloodo.org/test/">(test)</a>

	<script
	 src="http://ad.aloodo.com/ad.js"></script>

Or [use `tracking-warning-block`, as in the Aloodo
privacy policy,](http://www.aloodo.org/privacy/) for
longer explanations.  Today, with modern tracking
protection, sites can do better than just
AdChoices or ad blockers.  The first step is to show
users an opt out that works for everyone.
