In today's marketing news, [Amazon
is introducing a new ad retargeting
service](http://business.financialpost.com/technology/amazon-muscles-in-on-googles-billion-dollar-territory-with-new-display-ad-tool).

> The tool lets merchants selling on Amazonâ€™s online marketplace to purchase spots that will follow shoppers around the web to lure the consumers back to Amazon to buy. 

So far, pretty straightforward.  But the big question
for brand advertisers is: how does this new feature
interact with Amazon's

This clearly presents a problem for legit brands.

 1. Brand offers a product on Amazon.

 2. Some deceptive seller offers a counterfeit version.

 3. Shopper visits a page for the legit product.

 3. Deceptive seller out-bids the legit brand for
    retargeted ad impressions (which they can easily
    afford to do, because they're shipping
    a crappy product)

 4. Shopper returns to Amazon and buys the counterfeit
    product.

Amazon and the deceptive seller win; the original brand
and the customer lose.

For brands using a reputation-based
strategy, conventional data-driven marketing
tactics can only do so much to help here.
Today's adtech and martech platforms are optimized for
<q>[game-changing](https://blog.zgp.org/this-is-why-we-can-t-have-nice-brands/)</q>
interactions that tie marketers to third-party data
sources, not for brand building.  Targeted advertising
[tends to give an unfair advantage to deceptive
sellers](https://blog.aloodo.org/posts/tv-shopping-with-rory-sutherland/),
and the tools available to legit brands are less
well known.

Does this mean that ad agencies that create
value by helping to build brands now have an
opportunity (or even a responsibility) to include
tracking protection for customers as part of an
integrated strategy?  I know that the upcoming
[Nudgestock](http://www.nudgestockfestival.co.uk/)
is not just a marketing conference, but I'll be
speaking there and would be happy to discuss this
kind of thing if it comes up.
