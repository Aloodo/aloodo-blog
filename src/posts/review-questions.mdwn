Good question.  Brands are paying a lot of attention 
to technical infrastructure, when a creative ad can
make a much bigger difference than getting a little
more efficiency from the delivery system.

But we still have to ask some potentially awkward
questions about the technology side.  That's because,
on the web, the delivery system can't build a
brand, but it can help damage one.  In the search
for an agency, how can you reduce the chances that
you end up with [your beer commercial on an ISIS

So here are a few basic technology questions.  A good
agency already has someone thinking about this stuff,
and should be able to give you understandable answers,
without complicated computer science terms or acronym
alphabet soup.

1. If I see one of my ads running on a
[copyright-infringing](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/251638/how-madison-avenue-can-stop-funding-piracy.html)
or other illegal or
[fraudulent](http://www.slideshare.net/augustinefou/state-of-digital-ad-fraud-q1-2015-update-by-augustine-fou)
site, who is the one person I can call to get it
taken down and get a credit?

2.  [Apple

[Microsoft Internet
Explorer](http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/TrackingProtectionLists/faq.html),
and [Mozilla
Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tracking-protection-firefox)
all have built-in tracking protection support
available or coming soon, and tracking protection is
available for Google Chrome as an add-on.  How will
the rise of tracking protection as a [basic security
tool](/posts/end-user-security/) help your agency
work better online?  What are you changing to take
advantage of this trend?

3. Does your agency work with <q>[ad
injection](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub43346.html)</q>,
<q>[potentially unwanted
software](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/objectivecriteria.aspx)</q>
or other malicious software (<q>malware</q>), either
directly or indirectly?  How do you know that the
companies you work with are not supporting malware?

When an agency can give you clear answers on those,
you can go back to talking about the creative, where
the upside is.
