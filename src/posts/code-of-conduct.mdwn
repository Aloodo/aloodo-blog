The Newspaper Association of America has filed a
[complaint](http://www.naa.org/~/media/NAACorp/Public%20Files/PublicPolicy/GovernmentAffairs/NAA%20FTC%20Complaint_5-25-16.pdf)
(PDF) with the US Federal Trade Commission about four
ad blocking practices.  The NAA asks the FTC to:

 1. Require ad blockers engaged in **“paid
    whitelisting”** programs to end such programs
    or to cease misrepresenting the nature of their
    services to consumers.

 2. Require ad blockers to discontinue **ad substitution** practices.

 3. Require ad blockers claiming that they make
    publishers whole to cease making **deceptive statements**
    that mislead consumers.

 4. Prevent ad blockers from **evading** metered
    subscription services and paywalls.

(_Washington Post_ story: [Newspapers escalate their fight against ad
blockers by Elizabeth
Dwoskin](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/05/27/newspapers-escalate-their-fight-against-ad-blockers/))

If we clarify number 4 to include only deliberate
paywall avoidance, and not privacy measures that
accidentally reset the article count for "soft
paywalls", then NAA has just done a huge favor for
the developers of legit privacy tools.

**The NAA has written a pretty good start for a code
of conduct for privacy tool developers and users.**

Legit privacy tools are in "compliance"
with the NAA's rules already. If you look at
the [aloodo.org tracking protection tools
page](http://www.aloodo.org/protection/),
everything we link to or recommend already avoids
the four no-nos.  It shouldn't be a problem for
any tool to avoid all of these.  Paid whitelisting
is a naked protection racket, ad substitution is
reputation-harming scribbling of unreviewed ads
into a publisher's context (yes, adtech does it too,
that's not the point) and deception and sneaking in
without paying are just so obviously wrong that why
am I even typing this?

It's possible that some privacy tools can have the
result of resetting a soft paywall, but it's possible
to protect a soft paywall from accidental resets,
and I can get behind a code of conduct that bans
specific functionality to get around paywalls.


## Differentiating

The first reaction to the
NAA complaint was disappointing.
(Please, Twitter and Medium, copy this [YouTube
feature](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/youtube-adds-read-comment-aloud-feature-from-xkcd/)
already.)  A bunch of early comments were along the
lines of "well, existing adtech is bad, too!"

Yes, we know. Third-party tracking is not just
a privacy issue. The trackability of users
from high-value to low-value sites causes [data
leakage](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/what-is-data-leakage/),
which results in lower revenue for
publishers, and enables fraud.  And adtech targeting breaks [economic
signaling](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/signaling/),
which means publishers aren't just getting a smaller
piece of the pie, it's a smaller pie.

Today's adtech is a trash fire of fraud, malware,
and low revenue. But that means privacy tools have
the opportunity to be _different_, by avoiding
publisher-hostile schemes.  When software developers
send a privacy message but then just set a competing
trash fire, they're wasting that opportunity.

Legit privacy tools and high-reputation publishers,
working together, can transform advertising on the
web.  Tools and sites can help users block low-value,
cold-call-like targeted ads while permitting
signal-carrying ads, the ones that respect users'
choices not to be tracked.

High-reputation publishers have a responsibility to
both [educate readers about the problems of adtech as
usual](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/service-journalism/)
and hold tool vendors to high standards.  The NAA is
making some real progress here.
