The [Trichordist blog](https://thetrichordist.com/)
started pointing out the ad-supported piracy problem
quite a while ago, so let's have a quick look to see
how well the adtech business has done at cleaning up
its act.

Should no longer be a story, right?  The Internet
solves problems on Internet time, after all.

Here's the plan.  I'll spend one minute doing a basic
check, then go work on something else.  It's not as
if there isn't enough broken stuff on the Internet
I could be figuring out.

So I'll do a web search for

	[Michael Jackson MP3]

I'll make it easy for them by picking a well-known
non-Creative-Commons recording artist.  I'm expecting
to come up dry here.  (After all, why would any
sensible Internet company
send me to a pirate site when they could make some
money by sending me to a legit music download site,
or sell me some tracks themselves?)

Ouch.  Probably the [most
obvious copyrighted works in the
world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson#Legacy_and_influence),
and who's got their fingers in the pie?

 * Amazon
 * BuzzCity
 * Google, Google, Google
 * LinkShare
 * LiveInternet
 * OpenX

But turn off your banner blindness for a minute,
and check out that banner ad.

It's an ad for [The American National Standards
Institute (ANSI)](https://ansi.org/).

Why is ANSI running an ad on <strike>a
questionable</strike> an infriging site, when it
could be buying ads on a legit site that covers
engineering and science?  Spewing ads into the
web's less reputable corners just feeds the growing
impression that "technology" is a rent-seeking,
deluxe-bus-riding racket that's focused on diverting
value from others instead of creating new wealth.

So here are a few questions for ANSI.

 * How did your ad end up on an infringing site?  Can
   you retrace its steps?

 * What agencies or other intermediaries did you work
   with to place the ad?  Did they make any guarantees
   about what kind of site it would show up on?

 * Have you received a refund for ad impressions on
   problem sites?

 * If you don't have the information to answer the
   first three questions, what is broken about the
   way you buy advertising?

I'll keep you posted on what I come up with.
