**Update 7 Nov. 2016: As of today, privacy claims and
the "disable tracking" switch have
been removed from the Adblock Plus first install
page.** (Get real [tracking
protection](http://www.aloodo.org/protection/).)


_Consumer Reports_ has just published
["66 Ways to Protect Your Privacy Right
Now"](http://www.consumerreports.org/privacy/66-ways-to-protect-your-privacy-right-now/).

Many of those suggestions look good. But that should
probably be more like 65 ways.

One piece of software linked
to from the CR story is [Adblock
Plus](https://www.engadget.com/2016/02/12/rip-adblock-plus/),
which would be a better fit for CR's ["Selling
it"](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/selling/selling-it/selling-it-ov.htm)
feature on sneaky offers, weasel wording, and other
examples of gray-hat marketing.

## What's so bad about Adblock Plus?

When you first install Adblock Plus, the privacy
option looks good.  It says "Adblock Plus can do
more than block ads." Scroll down to the bottom
of the page, and you see

> Browse privately by disabling tracking - hiding your tracks from ad companies that would track your every move.

Looks good, so flip the "Disable Tracking" switch.

**Protected from tracking, right?  Wrong.**

It looks like you made the [responsible
choice](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#solution-tracking-protection),
and now you're protected. 

But start web-surfing with your browser's developer
tools open, and you'll see third-party trackers
from, for example, `googleads.g.doubleclick.net`.
What's up with that?  **How could it be that even
when you deliberately turn on "Disable Tracking"
you still get trackers?**

That's the tricky part.
The company's ["Acceptable Ads" whitelisting
program](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/25/adblock-plus-opens-up-acceptable-ads-work)
actually _overrides_ the other choices made
by the user, including that nifty little
"Disable Tracking" switch.  [Google and other
companies pay Adblock Plus for "Acceptable
Ads"](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-microsoft-amazon-taboola-pay-adblock-plus-to-stop-blocking-their-ads-2015-2?ashmanov).

Want to make your decision to block trackers actually
take effect? You'll find the other option that you
need in order to protect yourself in a different
dialog, cleverly but not helpfully labeled "Allow
some non-intrusive advertising".

  alt="whitelisting screenshot" /></a>

**To really disable trackers, un-check a box that
has a label that says nothing about trackers at all.**

It is possible for a user to configure AdBlock
Plus to block trackers.  And fixing something by
changing an option in one obvious place and again
in a not-so-obvious place is not really that bad, by
the standards of instructions for computer hobbyists.

But this isn't about a story in _Puzzles for
Computer Nerds Reports_, it's about _Consumer Reports_,
and "Consumers" probably expect things to be more
a little more straightforward.

**Next steps:** There are better ways to deal with
problem web ads, and [sites can help recommend them to
users](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/service-journalism/).
