Web advertising is a dangerous mess.  But why
keep thinking about it as a "let's have a meeting
about it" problem? It's more of a "what can I
fix now and make serious money doing it" problem.
Read on for a link to some JavaScript that a brand
advertiser ([or publication, but we covered that
before](/posts/the-verge-can-save-advertising/))
can start using today.

The opportunity comes from the fact that
low-reputation and high-reputation brands
[need fundamentally different qualities from an advertising
medium](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/tv-shopping-with-rory-sutherland/).

 * Low-reputation brands need to send ads only to
   people likely to respond.

 * High-reputation brands need to send a costly,
   hard-to-repudiate signal to an large audience.

When an ad medium is targetable, sellers lose the
ability to signal.  When an ad _could_ have been
targeted to a small group, you can see that the
advertiser isn't spending as much to reach you.

[Bob Hoffman
explains](http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2017/02/why-tiffany-doesnt-make-infomercials.html).

> Most people are pretty good behavioral economists. They may not know anything about how the products they buy work, but they know how to read the advertising signals.

Signaling failure is
obscured by all the other problems that web
advertising has.  You're lucky if
your brand's ad ends up being shown to an [adfraud
bot](http://digiday.com/marketing/confessions-ad-tech-developer/),
because if that ad gets through to a real
user, it's probably attached to a [beheading
video](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/big-brands-fund-terror-knnxfgb98)
or [conspiracy theories](https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/youtube-has-become-the-content-engine-of-the-internets-dark) or 
[malware](http://www.zdnet.com/article/malvertising-reached-new-heights-in-2016/)
or something.  What a shitshow.

People are still [nerding out over new
technologies](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/pre-peak-advertising/)
without fixing the obvious problems, never mind
the deep problem of signaling failure.


## Work together? Why not?

Fortunately, web advertising is not a
problem where "the industry" needs to
"work together".  Mark Glaser, on the
DCN site, [does an excellent job of identifying the
problems](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2017/02/23/need-solve-digital-advertisings-quality-control-problem-now/).
But he writes,

> If the demand for money and efficiency is eroding the integrity of content—not to mention that of brands and platforms—everyone involved must collaborate to gain that trust back.

In the IT business, this kind of call for coordinated
action is what executives from legacy
companies say while they're getting ready for an
expensive conference with a golf tournament. And they
say it right about the time that an independent programmer
in a basement somewhere is writing the code to eat
their lunch.  **When a whole industry is wrong about
something, that doesn't mean you have a big boring
assignment to persuade everyone in the industry. It means you have
an opportunity to make mad cash by being right.**
A good agency working independently can solve the
web advertising problem for one brand, just as a good
publication working independently can solve the web
advertising problem for its own audience.

If your idea of a solution to the web advertising
problem involves meetings about how everybody
has to solve the problem or nobody can, then
I've got nothing for you.  Go look at [cat
GIFs](https://www.reddit.com/r/StartledCats/)
or something.

Still with me?  Good.

The more that a user gets protected from tracking and
targeting, the more signalful the web becomes as an
ad medium from that user's point of view.  This can
work one user at a time.  No coordination required.
It's a matter of informing and nudging users to take
precautions and become less trackable. [Please
grab the code (it's open source) and try it
out](http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/howto/).  

What kinds of brand advertisers will be good early
adopters for tracking protection strategies?


## Does the brand have noisy, low-reputation competitors?

Some high-reputation categories are great fits for
tracking protection because there are so many rip-offs
using targeted web ads.

 * Insurance 
 
 * Financial services

 * Health care


## Does the brand depend on reputation earned over long-term use?

Look for goods that are difficult to evaluate at point
of purchase and where an experience with a deceptive
seller can be costly.

High-signal advertising is a way to take a position on
future customer satisfaction and what kind of word of
mouth that the brand is betting it will earn.

 * Tools

 * Cookware


## Is the email list an (expletive deleted) gold mine?

This is an easy one. If you already have the customers
reliably opening your email, or participating in
some other medium such as a customer web board,
you've got great data and nothing to lose by helping
to deny their info to the competition.  Play defense.


## Does the brand already have a tracking-protected customer base?

Some product categories already appeal to Internet
"privacy nerds" who are hard to reach by conventional
web ads.  Worse, conventional marketing tech is giving
you really bad numbers when enough of the customer
base is "invisible".  Tracking protection strategy
is essential here, just to keep from 
getting wrong answers.  Don't do a
big new product launch based on what bots want.


## Next steps

If you answered "yes" to one or more of these,
the first step is to collect some data on tracking
protection adoption among the brand's customers
and prospects.  A high-traffic support or service
page is a good place to install [tracking protection
measurement](http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/howto/)
to get a baseline measurement on how well-protected
the audience is.  From there, it's a creative
marketing project to customize a tracking protection
campaign&mdash;something new and different to offer
to a brand stuck in the online advertising mess.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
