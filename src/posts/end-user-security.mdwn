[Malvertising](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=malvertising)
is a thing on the Internet now.  [Ad
fraud](http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-difference-between-waste-and-fraud.html)
meets [data
leakage](http://digiday.com/platforms/what-is-data-leakage/)
meets malware.

One way or another, some kind of tracking protection
tool is going to join the basic recommended list
of security software for regular users.  Firewall,
check. Virus checker, check. Tracking protection,
check.

The question is whether the anti-malvertising
slot on the shoppping list will be filled with a
[problematic](http://qz.com/308175/the-rise-of-adblock-reveals-a-serious-problem-in-the-advertising-world/)
and coarse-grained ad blocker, or with a
[publisher-friendly](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#solution-tracking-protection)
tracking protection tool such as
[Disconnect](https://disconnect.me/)
or the [built-in tracking protection in
Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tracking-protection-firefox).

## What's the difference, and why does it matter?

Tracking protection tools and AdBlock Plus
will each let some ads through.  However,
AdBlock Plus uses the concept of ["acceptable
ads"](https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads),
which is broken for modern web designs.

> text content, below it or on the sides.

So a nice-looking design like [Quartz](http://qz.com/)
does not have "acceptable" ads because the ads there
can appear when scrolling a long article, but a
crap-ass legacy CMS that splits a shorter article
into 9 pages is A-OK.

More importantly, targeted third-party ads can buy
into the "acceptable" program too, which does nothing
for improving the value of the medium.

This is where the IT media can influence, not just
observe. 

 * The more that you write about tracking protection
   tools other than ad blockers, the more users will
   get them, and the better that business becomes for
   content sites, including the ones that pay you.

 * The less attention you pay to the issue, the more
   users are likely to switch to a "dumb" ad blocker,
   and the more that web ads slide into a no-win
   struggle like email spam/anti-spam.
