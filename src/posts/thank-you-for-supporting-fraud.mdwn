Former media buyer Rick Webb [explains to web
publishers](https://medium.com/@RickWebb/banner-fraud-doesn-t-matter-fc84413fe59c)
why ad fraud is a leak in _your_ end of the boat, and
so not his problem.

>  We use banners as little billboards now. We use them strategically as incredibly cheap (so cheap) repeat impressions for brand awareness. We know many people don’t see them, we know most people don’t see them.  That’s okay. We use them accordingly, and the cost has been adjusted down to make them a perfectly great buy even though most people don’t see them.  We use them to measure the efficacy of campaigns we run _our_ way, using _our_ metrics.

Webb&apos;s method for dealing with ad fraud is:

 * Rely on the presence of huge quantities of
   fraudulent traffic to drive down CPMs everywhere.
   Buy a mix of fraudulent and legit banner impressions
   at massive scale.

 * Because fraud makes adtech data unreliable, 
   measure banner impact with offline tools,
   as you would for a billboard.

The bottom feeding strategy solves Webb&apos;s side
of the problem in the short term.  Instead of trying
to capture the dubious value of data-driven thought
leader insights and all that jive, buy many
crap impressions to extract tiny amounts of
[signaling](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#signaling)
value, like scraping milligrams of gold from a
mountain of e-waste.

I checked in with ad strategist [Eaon
Pritchard](http://eaonpritchard.blogspot.com/) about
how well this actually works.
He compared questionable banner
ads to cheap, remnant
late-night TV inventory, which is no bargain
considering the small audience size.  <q>Big media
(ie high rating sites and TV) with less frequency is
always the best option in terms of quality/signal
and reach, but that sounds terribly old-fashioned
these days.</q>

Advertising always has two jobs: selling stuff
to people and selling itself to the client.
Bottom feeding comes in when the client wants to be on
the Internet, and effective but out-of-style offline
media are out of consideration. So the agency 
uses low-quality web ads as a less-effective alternative to
radio or TV.


Shifting the pain of ad fraud
-----------------------------

Low-quality, low-reach web ads are different from
low-quality, low-reach TV ads, though.  A TV signal
broadcasted to nobody is just a waste of electricity,
but ad fraud supports activities that actively harm
publishers and users.

 * Ad fraud [is now the number one malware payload](http://adage.com/article/digital/inside-google-s-secret-war-ad-fraud/298652/).  When
   bottom feeders pay indiscriminately
   for fraudulent and legit banners, they fund
   malware development.  Looking for someone
   to blame for the crap you keep having to clean
   off your uncle&apos;s PC?  You found him.

 * Low-quality impressions don&apos;t pay for
   original sites, but instead encourage
   a bunch of other bad behavior, from [copyright infringement](http://thetrichordist.com/2012/07/23/wall-of-shame-bmw-willing-to-drive-without-license/)
   to comment spam.

 * When advertisers buy programmatically on markets
   that include both legit and fraudulent inventory,
   publishers pay for fraud in the form of lower CPMs.

Although Webb only covers one point of view
about one strategy, he does help us
understand why advertisers have been so <q>meh</q>
about the ad fraud problem.  While Bob Hoffman [points
out](http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2014/12/what-every-ceo-needs-to-know-about.html)
that <q>If your company is spending money on online
advertising, you are almost certainly being robbed,</q>
and the IAB convenes expensive-sounding committees,
nobody is making much progress. Instead, a halfway
solution is emerging: shift the costs of fraud away
from advertisers and onto users, copyright holders,
and publishers.

The fraud issue is helping to form a more realistic
view of the role of third-party tracking and ad
targeting on the web. Proponents of tracking often
promise AI-driven highly effective attributable touch
points&mdash;but in practice, much of what third-party
tracking and targeting enables is less
[heroic](http://battellemedia.com/archives/2013/11/why-the-banner-ad-is-heroic-and-adtech-is-our-greatest-technology-artifact.php).
Track a known good user from a
high-reputation site, and [serve that user cheap
impressions](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#targeting-failure-legit-sites-lose-intermediarieswin)
on low-reputation sites or through malware.


If advertisers won't fight fraud, who will?
-------------------------------------------

The response to the bottom feeding strategy, for publishers, is to
get the audience out of the pool of commoditized
<q>eyeballs</q> where fraud can reach them.
One approach is,
well, if you&apos;re being raided by Vikings, pick the
baddest Viking and make him your king. [Emily Bell explains
that
one](http://www.themediabriefing.com/article/newsletter-july-17th-emily-bell-how-the-great-reintermediation-of-the-web-caused-publishers-to-lose-control-of-distribution-6-pillars-of-a-revenue-gen).  Facebook has
an incentive to protect its own locked-down platform
from fraud, so <q>Facebook is extremely good at
monetising mobile audiences in a way that publishers
simply are not.</q>

The other logical move for publishers is to work
with tracking protection.  Inform, nudge, and
reward users to turn on [some of the great new web
functionality](http://www.aloodo.org/protection/) that
blocks fraud-prone third-party ads without interfering
with higher-value ads.  A tracking protection
strategy does not require giving up on Facebook
or on conventional ad networks, but can [work in
parallel](http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/site-request/)
with them.


Measuring the problem
---------------------

In a way, bottom feeder advertisers are doing
publishers a favor, by spreading information about
the state of the market.  Brand-unsafe placements and
ad-supported piracy can help everyone get a better
idea of where the fraud-tolerant ad money is going,
and how to cut it off.  Sites that are crappy enough
not to get regular users, but just clean enough not
to get taken down, will be the first place to look.

With a little more effort, the other place to look is
within demand side platforms.  Tracking protection,
including publisher tracking protection strategy,
affects the price of marginal banners&mdash; the
ones just barely possibly non-fraudulent enough to
be saleable.  More on that coming soon.

Tracking protection gives legit advertisers
the power to turn the web into a [more
valuable](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#fig1)
ad medium. And advertisers who
balance on the ethical line give us a way to measure
our progress.  So I have to thank Webb and the rest of
the bottom feeders, but now the
rest of us have some work to do.
