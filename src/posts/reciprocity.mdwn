Users say that they're blocking ads because of the
annoyance. But that can't be the whole reason that
ad blocking is just recently starting to catch on. The
reasons for web ad blocking have been there since
the beginning. Distracting blinky ads, slow page load
times, security concerns, the whole mess.

The ease of use of ad blocking has also been roughly
constant for more than a decade. For a long time,
it's been easy to find an ad blocker that is easy to
install and use.

So what changed?  Why did the first generation of
easy, effective ad blockers&mdash;Internet Junkbuster,
WebWasher, AdSubtract, and others&mdash;completely
fail to catch on, while today ad blocking is a thing?

form of targeted advertising that is easily visible
to users&mdash;ads that users can see <q>following
them around.</q>

 * The blue line is a query for <q>how to block
ads</q>.  Users looking for a solution.

Why does the blue line start to take off only after the
red line?  Web ads were just as annoying before
users started to see how they were targeted.
What is it about _targeted_ ads that changed the
decision to block?  Why was the 2010 [What They
Know series in the Wall Street Journal such a big
deal](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2010/07/31/the-data-bubble/)?

Until the Thought Leaders of Marketing can come up
with an answer to that, all they can do is get their
pearls re-strung with Spectra&reg;, to handle the
outbreak of extreme pearl-clutching.

Maybe we should take a step back.  Maybe the problem
is: Do we really understand what the basic bargain
behind advertising is?  Why do people put up with
advertising in some media but block it in others?

That's one kind of exchange.  It's the **lead
generation bargain**.  Fill out this form to WATCH
OUR FREE WEBINAR!  People choose to reveal personal
info all the time, every time they enter a sweepstakes
or swipe a supermarket loyalty card.

But are users _passively_ choosing to share data with
unknown third parties (quick, name three companies
that ran trackers on the last news story you
read, and what they do with your data)?  Survey
says....[no](http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/03/09/main-findings-11/).

And is the lead generation bargain the only bargain
that matters in advertising?

Lead generation can send a special offer to buy a
product for a lower price...

<img alt="Beacons beam rich-media mobile
messages to passers-by: 80% OFF"
width="100%" src="/images/80-percent.jpeg">

...but can it build a brand that people will be happy
to pay a _higher_ price for?

Clearly the lead generation bargain has not
been the point of high-value old-school
ad media such as TV, radio, and print.
Nobody gives up any personal data to watch [Knight
Rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Rider_%281982_TV_series%29)
on broadcast TV, or buy a copy
of the newspaper out of a vending machine.  But that
[impersonal](http://richardstacy.com/2012/08/30/the-great-thing-about-advertising-is-that-no-one-takes-it-personally/)
advertising is where the money is.  Something must
be making it valuable.

The bargain that matters in
advertising's big leagues is the exchange of
[signal](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#signaling)
for a user's attention.  An ad can be a public,
credible, costly display of the advertiser's
intentions.  When an ad fails to send a signal,
as is the case when it's targeted to a user, the ad
doesn't hold up its end of the **signal-for-attention
bargain**, and users start looking for an opportunity
to block it.

Which is where all those opinion pieces about
the problem of ad blocking are only getting half
the story.  One way to look at the problems is to
accuse ad blocker users of violating a reciprocity
norm, by entering into an implied lead generation
bargain and then failing to hold up their end.
But the other, more valuable deal&mdash;the
signal-for-attention bargain&mdash;is the one that
advertisers broke first, and set the problem off.


How to hold up both bargains?
-----------------------------

One important direction is to make the lead generation
bargain explicit, not sneaky.  Instead of using
malware-like data gathering techniques, make it easier
for users to control how they share their info.
[Project VRM](https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/)
is working on that.

The other half, and the part that the [Aloodo
project](http://www.aloodo.org/) is all about,
is restoring the signal-for-attention bargain. Fixing
signaling, by enabling tracking protection, makes the
web into a more trustworthy medium, and also helps
with the problem of ad fraud. Instead of point
solutions to blocking and fraud, tracking protection
both

 * cuts off the data leakage that drives fraud and 

 * prevents the unease-inducing cross-site
   tracking that motivates users to block ads.

A unified approach to blocking and fraud is better
than taking on either one by itself.  You can't even
measure blocking accurately without a good measurement
of fraud.  And trying to reduce the amount of fraud
on its own is likely to drive blocking up, while
trying to reduce blocking is likely to create new
opportunities for fraud.

## We should have an expensive conference about this!

Sorry, no conference. This is not a collective action
problem, and this is not a conference-convening
solution.  It's an opportunity to quietly help
redesign the way advertising works on the web,
whether you have a brand site, an original content
site, or a blog.

The independent sites and brands that
act first to help get their users [running
tracking protection in place of a general ad
blocker](/posts/end-user-security/) will be the
first to be able to signal effectively.  Building
brands that pass Bob Hoffman's <q>[refrigerator
test](http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2015/05/take-refrigerator-test.html)</q>
will be the bonus for beating blocking and fraud.

If you're a Big Data fan, and if you think that
throwing more data-collection technology at the
problem will solve it, then this is not for you.
Otherwise, here are a few [next steps for anyone with
a web site](/misc/site-request/).  We promise that it
will always be just as easy as adding a social button
or analytics script.  Try it on a blog or low-traffic
page and see how it goes.
