The [ad.aloodo.com](https://ad.aloodo.com/) site
is now on the [Kloudsec](https://kloudsec.com/)
CDN, using Kloudsec's automatic support for [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

I'm not bragging on my own elite skills
here. It only took about five minutes of
actual work.  (Not counting [fixing a problem on our
side](https://github.com/Aloodo/ad.aloodo.com/commit/8761f57b3d40afa3f04057f03531675f61cc1b7d)
that one of our users ran into when switching to the
HTTPS version of Aloodo.)

Why is going encrypted now so simple from the
webmaster point of view?  Because Kloudsec took
the great work of the Let's Encrypt project and
built a straightforward web workflow around it,
complete with checking and troubleshooting for the
parts they can't automate, such as setting up the
right records in DNS.  We use GitHub Pages to host
ad.aloodo.com, and Kloudsec has [a GitHub Pages
integration](https://kloudsec.com/github-pages/new)
to make it even easier.

By the way, we also now have a [global
CDN](https://kloudsec.com/#/features/speed).


## Protecting users from targeted ads

Putting your site on HTTPS can block ad injection
attacks on users of your site.  I remember the first
time I went to the Oakland airport and saw injected
ads on one of my own sites.  Please check out Let's
Encrypt and Kloudsec to help protect your users.

And of course, another important kind of
protection you can offer is a tracking protection
warning, with Aloodo.  [Here's how to get
started.](http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/howto/)
