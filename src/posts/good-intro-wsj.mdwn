Geoffrey A. Fowler, at the _Wall Street Journal_,
shares some good first steps for users to to
protect themselves from online tracking, in
[Don’t Expose Yourself: A Guide to Online
Privacy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-expose-yourself-a-guide-to-online-privacy-1496249766).  Read the whole thing, even if you have tracking
protection.  Lots of up-to-date recommendations on 
current tools and opt-out options.

But the personal side of web tracking protection is
only part of the story.  Walt Mossberg [ran into the
business side of the tracking problem while at _The
Verge_](http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14304276/walt-mossberg-online-ads-bad-business):

> About a week after our launch, I was seated at a dinner next to a major advertising executive. He complimented me on our new site’s quality and on that of a predecessor site we had created and run, AllThingsD.com. I asked him if that meant he’d be placing ads on our fledgling site. He said yes, he’d do that for a little while. And then, after the cookies he placed on Recode helped him to track our desirable audience around the web, his agency would begin removing the ads and placing them on cheaper sites our readers also happened to visit. In other words, our quality journalism was, to him, nothing more than a lead generator for target-rich readers, and would ultimately benefit sites that might care less about quality.

High-reputation sites such as the _Wall Street Journal_ 
can't enforce ad standards when an
original content site is in direct competition
with bottom-feeder and fraud sites that claim to
reach the same audience. But when users install privacy tools such as 
[Better by ind.ie](https://ind.ie/) and [EFF Privacy
Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger),
a lot of problematic ad inventory
goes away.  [Crap sites can only make money
from users who are vulnerable to third-party
tracking](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/facepalm/).
When tracking protection tools keep ad money from
flowing to crappy and fraud sites, then the _Wall
Street Journal_ wins.

[Real, high-reputation
sites have branding advantages over generic
eyeball-buying](http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2016/The-Halo-Effect-How-Advertising-on-Premium-Publishers-Drives-Higher-Ad-Effectiveness).
and users are concerned and confused about web ads.
That's an opportunity for a high-reputation publisher
to get users safely protected from tracking, and not
caught up in publisher-hostile schemes such as [paid
whitelisting](http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/12/rip-adblock-plus/),
[ad
injection](http://www.businessinsider.com/newspaper-publishers-send-cease-and-desist-to-brave-browser-2016-4),
and [fake ad
blockers](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/cybercrime/2015/05/fake-adblocker-bylekh-is-an-lsp-hijacker/).
