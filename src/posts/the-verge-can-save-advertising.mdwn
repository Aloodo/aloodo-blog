Walt Mossberg, at The Verge,
[points out that lousy ads are ruining the online
experience](http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14304276/walt-mossberg-online-ads-bad-business).

No doubt about that.  Web ads are crap.

Just try reading the same newspaper story in print and
online. In print it's next to a professionally-shot
photo in a kitchen remodeling ad. On the web it's
next to YOU WILL DIE FROM LIVER FUNGUS UNLESS YOU
CLICK ON THIS INFECTED LIVER NOW, done in MS Paint.

And it seems to be getting worse, not better.
(Not surprisingly, [ad blocking keeps going
up](http://www.businessinsider.com/pagefair-2017-ad-blocking-report-2017-1).)
The ads that provoke blocking and
[mockery](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2009/07/14/evolution-of-evony-video-game-ads/)
are the same ones that get clicks.  Everyone
agrees that "we" need to get rid of "bad" ads.
But naturally, "we" is defined as "you" and "bad" is
"not the ads that work for me."

Print ads stay tolerable because in print, publishers
have the market power to enforce standards.  On the
web, not so much.  [Mossberg again (read the whole
thing)](http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14304276/walt-mossberg-online-ads-bad-business):

> About a week after our launch, I was seated at a dinner next to a major advertising executive. He complimented me on our new site’s quality and on that of a predecessor site we had created and run, AllThingsD.com. I asked him if that meant he’d be placing ads on our fledgling site. He said yes, he’d do that for a little while. And then, after the cookies he placed on Recode helped him to track our desirable audience around the web, his agency would begin removing the ads and placing them on cheaper sites our readers also happened to visit. In other words, our quality journalism was, to him, nothing more than a lead generator for target-rich readers, and would ultimately benefit sites that might care less about quality.

Publishers can't enforce ad standards when an
original content site is in direct competition
with bottom-feeder and fraud sites that claim to
reach the same audience.  As Aram Zucker-Scharff
[mentions in an interview on the Poynter Institute
site](http://www.poynter.org/2016/ad-tech-is-broken-heres-how-newsrooms-can-fix-it/407800/),
the number of third-party trackers on a site grows
as new advertising deals bring new trackers along
with them.  Those trackers leak audience data
into the dark corners of the Lumascape until the same data
re-emerges, attached to a low-value or fraudulent
site that can claim to reach the same audience
as the original publisher.  [Deceptive and extremist
sites](https://apnews.com/f88cd998717c4977a7eacf3679ebc63a/Intentionally-or-not,-big-brands-help-fund-fake-news)
are part of a larger problem. They're just especially
good at playing the same adtech game that all
low-value sites do.

So how to turn web advertising from a
race to the bottom into a sustainable
revenue source, like print or TV ads?
How can the web work better for [high-reputation
brands](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/tv-shopping-with-rory-sutherland/)
that depend on costly
[signaling](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/signaling/)?

The good news for cash-crunched news sites is that
the hard work of web-ad-saving software development
must happen, and is happening, on the browser side.
Every time a user turns on a protection tool such as
[Better by ind.ie](https://ind.ie/), [EFF Privacy
Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger),
or the experimental [Firefox Tracking
Protection](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/tracking-protection),
a little bit of problematic ad inventory
goes away.  [Crap sites can only make money
from users who are vulnerable to third-party
tracking](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/facepalm/).
When tracking protection tools keep ad money out
of the nasty corners of the internet, legit
sites can win.

For example, if a chain restaurant wants to advertise
to people in a town, today they have a choice:
support local news, or pay intermediaries who
follow local users to low-value sites.  When the
users get protected from tracking, opportunities to
reach them by tracking tend to go away, and market
power returns to the local news site.

The Verge and other legit sites are a key part
of the solution.  The problems of web advertising
have grown over years, and won't go away all at
once.  Sites will have to fix it in a data-driven,
incremental way.  Fortunately, we're getting the data
to make it happen.

**Measure the tracking-protected audience.** Tracking
protection is a powerful sign of a human audience. A
legit site can report a tracking protection percentage
for its audience, and any adtech intermediary who
claims to offer advertisers the same audience,
but delivers a suspiciously low tracking protection
number, is clearly pushing a mismatched or bot-heavy
audience and is going to have a harder time getting
away with it.  Showing prospective advertisers your
tracking protection data lets you reveal the tarnish
on the adtech "Holy Grail"&mdash;the promise of
high-value eyeballs on crappy sites.

Tracking protection is hard to
measure accurately, because there are
many different kinds.  What works for detecting [AVG
Crumble](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crumble-%E2%80%93-online-privacy/icpfjjckgkocbkkdaodapelofhgjncoh?hl=en)
might not work to detect [Privacy
Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger).
[But now anyone with basic web metrics and
JavaScript skills can do the measurement
with the Aloodo un-tracking pixel and
scripts](http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/howto/).

**Use data to sell brands on Flight
to Quality.** [Real, high-quality
sites have branding advantages over generic
eyeball-buying](http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2016/The-Halo-Effect-How-Advertising-on-Premium-Publishers-Drives-Higher-Ad-Effectiveness),
and [adfraud is becoming a mainstream
concern](http://www.wsj.com/articles/doubts-about-digital-ads-rise-over-new-revelations-1474674323).
The complex adtech that tracking protection protects
against is also the place where fraud hides.  (Adtech
also tends to [drag brands into Internet poo-flinging
contests by attaching them to controversial
sites](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/business/media/breitbart-vanguard-ads-follow-users-target-marketing.html),
but that's another story.)

Higher-reputation publishers need
more and better data to take to numbers-craving CMOs.
Much of that data will have to come from the
tracking-protected audience.  When quality sites
share tracking protection data with advertisers, 
that helps expose the [adfraud that intermediaries 
have no incentive to track
down](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/thank-you-for-supporting-fraud/).

**Use service journalism.** Users are already
concerned and confused about web ads.  That's an
opportunity for The Verge.  The more that someone
learns about how web advertising works, the more
that he or she is motivated to get protected.
A high-reputation publisher can win by getting
users safely protected from tracking, and not
caught up in publisher-hostile schemes such as [paid
whitelisting](http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/12/rip-adblock-plus/),
[ad
injection](http://www.businessinsider.com/newspaper-publishers-send-cease-and-desist-to-brave-browser-2016-4),
and [fake ad
blockers](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/cybercrime/2015/05/fake-adblocker-bylekh-is-an-lsp-hijacker/).

Here is a great start, on the _New York Times_ site.

Some ways to both help users and work in the interests
of a quality site include:

 * review and recommend tracking protection tools,
   as a new part of everyone's basic security toolkit

 * [Detect users who are vulnerable to third-party
   tracking](http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/howto/), and
   recommend your site's top-rated tool for their
   platform.

 * Offer bonus content to tracking-protected users.

Can't hurt to [expose the protection racket behind

Plus](http://www.businessinsider.com/criteo-pays-adblock-plus-to-appear-on-its-acceptable-ads-whitelist-2015-12),
either.


**Beware nerds who claim to fix everything
(including me).** High-reputation sites are
still skeptical about alternate web business
models, which is a good move.  Better to put
the resources into doing some [careful adblocker
workarounds](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/reinvention-not-reinsertion/),
[advocating responsible tracking
protection](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2016/04/27/service-journalism-and-the-web-advertising-problem/),
and working on magazine-style
ads where the [four-currency
price](http://www.fortressofdoors.com/ad-blockers-and-the-four-currencies/)
of accepting the ad is lower than the four-currency
price of blocking it.


# Upgrading web advertising to a high-signal medium

Why do people [watch and share Super Bowl
commercials](http://www.businessinsider.com/all-the-super-bowl-ads-so-far-2017-1)
while [web ad blocking continues to trend
up](http://www.businessinsider.com/report-says-ad-blocking-is-worsening-2017-2)?  

The problem is that the story of web advertising
has been one of frantically throwing technology
at the lowest-value parts of the ad business while
reducing the power of web ads to get a piece of the
high-value parts.  People who live in market economies
are pretty good applied behavioral economists.
They'll pay attention to ads that pay their way, with
[signal](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2015/08/19/wheres-the-signal/),
while avoiding cold calls and ads that, through
tracking and targeting, work like a cold call and
fail to carry signal.

[Tim Sullivan and Ray
Fisman](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-super-bowl-ad-is-the-equivalent-of-lighting-money-on-fire-which-can-be-more-strategic-than-it-sounds): 

> The challenge facing sellers of some genuine product—be it true late-night love or a Tiffany necklace on eBay — and the buyers in search of them is to prove that they’re not just full of empty words.  This is where Super Bowl ads come in. Airtime during the game is, of course, fantastically expensive. So why do companies bother buying it? For the same reason that gang members get face tattoos: to prove that they’re in it for the long haul.

[Pedro Gardete](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/pedro-gardete-real-price-cheap-talk):

> The researchers found that highly targeted and personalized ads may not translate to higher profits for companies because consumers find those ads less persuasive.

Privacy projects such as [Better by
ind.ie](https://ind.ie/), [EFF Privacy
Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger),
and [Firefox Tracking
Protection](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/tracking-protection)
aren't just ways to implement the kind
of personal data protection that [users
want](http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/03/09/main-findings-11/).
Those projects can also work in the interests
of high-reputation sites, by making signaling
work better.  Sites like The Verge can help, by
helping users squeeze out the signal-destroying
tracking and targeting, and helping web ads become
a signal-carrying medium.
