Bob Hoffman [asks](http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2016/09/who-stole-ads-from-ad-week.html), 

> Who Stole The Ads From Ad Week?  I'm on my third morning at Advertising Week and I've yet to see an ad.

All right, Bob, here's some 21st-century advertising.
(You're welcome.)

![Jeep ad](/images/jeep-ad.png)

That's the kind of thing that the sessions at the
big conferences are all about.  It's a targeted ad.

But even though targeting and the technology behind
it are core subjects at Advertising Week, somehow
everyone knows that it would be uncouth, unwise,
or both to show targeted ads to people there.

Advertising Week participants recognize at some
level that actually showing a targeted ad to someone
is an act of communication aggression. It treats
the recipient as a component of a mechanism,
like a [flask moving down a bottling line at a
distillery](https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/01/10/on-marketings-terminal-addiction-to-personal-data-fracking-and-bad-guesswork/).

In the Jeep ad above, I'm targeted as a person who
doesn't drive off-road and basically can get by with
a minivan.  So instead of honestly communicating about
the qualities of the Jeep brand, they throw together
something that some algorithm says is more my speed.

The only information that ad offers me about Jeep is
a little insight into what that algorithm, that Jeep
paid for, thinks about me.  Some new Jeep has the same
kind of electronic doo-dads as every other new car does,
and the software predicts that I care.

Brand advertising works differently.  [Rory Sutherland
explains](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/tv-shopping-with-rory-sutherland/)
how people with limited information about complex
buying decisions can use reputation to help.
Reputation is hard to build, brand ads can help if
you do them right, and those ads are the kind of
thing that you show at a conference.

Brand advertising does have complicated math in
it, but it's behavioral economics math, with the
calculations done on the "reputation coprocessor"
in the user's brain. (For the data nerds out there,
reputation-based advertising is like rendering your
graphics on the GPU on the client, instead of paying
for cycles in the data center.  Reputation math is
way cooler, and has way more force multipliers hidden
in it, than direct response math.  But the power to
use that math looks "creative" so is out of fashion.)

So many of the proposals for funding Journalism are
based on allowing people to buy out of seeing ads.
That only makes sense if you assume that ads
are all targeted, not worthy of being shown at
a conference, and adversarial.  But when the web
can fix a few old bugs, valuable print-like ads
can emerge.  One bright spot: [Firefox Tracking
Protection is now available as a Test Pilot
experiment](https://testpilot.firefox.com/).  Give it
a try. A lot of the targeted ads will disappear, but
you might just find your inner behavioral economist
paying some attention to the ads that remain.
