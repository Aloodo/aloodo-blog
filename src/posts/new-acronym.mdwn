The IAB has come up with 
["L.E.A.N."](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/lean-beef/)
and
["D.E.A.L."](http://www.iab.com/iab-tech-lab-publisher-ad-blocking-primer/)
for strategies to face down the ad blocking
problem.  But if that's all we do, we would be wasting
a crisis here.  Worse, we have the adfraud crisis
happening at the same time, so we would be wasting
two crises.

The big problem from the web publisher point of
view is:

**The same content brings in an order of magnitude less
ad revenue on the web than in print.**

src="http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/minutes.svg"></a>

From the advertiser point of view, that looks like:

**The web is a low-value advertising medium.**

Making changes around the edges to try to slow down
ad blocking won't help that.  Web advertising
is still on the downward slope of the [peak
advertising curve](http://peakads.org/) that any
targetable ad medium goes through.  For example.
the "E" in "D.E.A.L." is a weak link.  Explaining
how web ads work today is likely to build more
interest in blocking.  The more targetable an ad
is, the more rational it is to ignore, block,
or regulate it.  It's only 
[good behavioral economics to pay attention to
advertising](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/tv-shopping-with-rory-sutherland/)
when the ad medium can carry a hard-to-repudiate signal.

We can't get web ads out of the ad blocking rut, but
there are ways to make the web work as a low-fraud,
high-signal medium and get it off the peak advertising
curve entirely.  Doc Searls

Good idea.  We can take the qualities that
next-generation web advertising must have, and make
them spell out a word.  Best if the word makes
it clear that we're working on the core problem.
We don't have an "ad blocking problem" and an "ad
fraud problem". We have one problem, and ad blocking
and ad fraud are two symptoms.

So, acronym.  Right. Let me take a whack at it.

**CNAMEs:** Ads, and other third-party resources
such as analytics scripts, served from what looks
to the browser like a subdomain of the publisher's
domain, not from a third-party domain that appears
on multiple publisher sites.  This is a small
change for third parties, but a big barrier to
<q>cookie licking</q> fraud.   And [responsible
privacy tools](http://www.aloodo.org/protection/)
won't block a dedicated subdomain that can't be used
to track users across sites.

**HTML5:** avoid the malvertising risks of
<q>vintage</q>
plugins by using web standards only.  Maintaining a
reasonably secure device on today's Internet is hard
enough. Users can't maintain
problematic software just to see the ads.

**Encryption:** Limit the ability of ISPs and other
observers to gather user data that can be used for
targeting later.

**Data leakage protection:** Many users are still
unprotected from web tracking.   When appropriate,
[notify them and offer incentives to get
protected](http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/howto/).
(This is especially important for brands in
data-sensitive categories such as health care,
and for high-reputation brands that compete with
low-reputation ones in categories such as financial
services and travel.)

**DNT:** Respect user norms on tracking across
sites.  (Update 26 April 2016: Show that you do this by
hosting a copy of the [EFF
DNT policy](https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy) on
the ad server.)  Respecting DNT is better than tricking
users into giving up information, because [eventually,
users figure out what they're uncomfortable
with](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-07/facebook-said-to-face-decline-in-people-posting-personal-content)
and take steps to protect themselves.  Meet the users
where they are instead of trying to move norms.

**Accountability:** accurate WHOIS info for
everything.  No anonymous registrations.
[Rob Leathern explains this better than I
can](https://medium.com/@robleathern/deception-funds-your-online-news-86926a2dfbbe#.g5ycatk9w).
Malvertising and fraud are [too
easy](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/worst-heist-movie-ever/)
otherwise.  (**Update:** important for
publisher sites too because of the [brand-supported
piracy](https://thetrichordist.com/2013/01/28/over-50-major-brands-supporting-music-piracy-its-big-business/)
problem.  Any real solution to brand-supported piracy
depends on cleaning up both third-party tracking, to
protect users from being tracked to infringing sites,
and contact info for any site where an ad can appear.)

**Reciprocity:** Now you have an ad medium that's
worth something to both ends.  It restores the
essential bargain of advertising: an offer of
**signal** from the advertiser for **attention**
from the audience.  The result is an ad system that's
harder for scammers to defraud, valuable for the
advertisers who pay for it, and rational for users
to accept.

So does **C.H.E.D.D.A.R.** work
for you?  Let me know, or just [get
started](http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/site-request/).
