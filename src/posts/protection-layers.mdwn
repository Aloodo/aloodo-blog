_(update 17 Mar 2020: Add link to Cookie AutoDelete to replace
Self-Destructing Cookies)_

Marchese is right that the wide-open,
completely trackable web browsers of the
1990s are no longer workable on today's
Internet.  When a browser allows third parties
to follow users from site to site, it enables [data
leakage](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#targeting-failure-legit-sites-lose-intermediarieswin),
fraud, and malware, and makes the web as a medium less
trustworthy.

But dumb ad blockers aren't the
solution either. If you like reading
William Gibson stories today, thank an [OMNI
Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omni_%28magazine%29)
advertiser from the 1980s.
Advertising done right can [support great photography, reporting,
and fiction](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/signaling/)
that would not otherwise exist.

Somehow, the browser needs to both protect sites and
users from the problems of intrusive tracking and also
protect the power of advertising to support journalism
and cultural works.  We can get a peek at
the browser of the future by looking at what works
on the leading
browsers and privacy extensions today.


0. Send accurate Do Not Track
-----------------------------

Inform sites of the user’s preferences on
data sharing.  Mainstream browsers already
do this, and [now that MSIE does not set DNT by
default](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/04/03/microsoft_reverses_ie_dnt_position/),
it's a clear message about what the user intends.


1. Block connections to third-party trackers
--------------------------------------------

Browsers have to be able to avoid connecting
to any third-party site that does not
comply with user norms. This may take the form
of honoring a blocklist, like [Tracking Protection for
Firefox](http://monica-at-mozilla.blogspot.com/2015/05/tracking-protection-for-firefox-at-web.html),
monitoring tracking behavior, like [Privacy
Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger), or both.
(In some cases, third-party tracking is gatewayed
through a first-party host, so layer 1 protection
may need to block URL paths, not just hosts.)


2. Limit data sent to third-party sites
---------------------------------------

Apple Safari's third-party cookie
policy is the best-known example
of layer 2 protection. [Cookie double
keying](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=565965),
where the same tracker will see different
values for the same cookie on different sites,
is another way to limit third-party data
collection.  The [Crumble extension for Google
Chrome](http://now.avg.com/introducing-crumble/)
appears to implement cookie double-keying.

Layer 2 protection is important in the case of
third-party sites that both provide user-visible
functionality and permit data leakage.  (Privacy
Badger uses layer 2, in the form of cookie blocking,
for its "yellowlist" domains.)


3 Scramble or delete unsafe data
--------------------------------

If a tracking cookie or other identifier
does get through, delete or scramble it on
leaving the site or later, as the
[Cookie AutoDelete](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/)
extension (similar to the old <q>Self-Destructing Cookies</q>)
does. This layer of protection matters in
two important situations.

 * Clean up browser state after a site visit in which
   the user turned off layer 1 or 2 protection. When
   sites ask the user “turn off your ad blocker to
   see this content” the user is choosing to accept
   the ads on the page, but is not choosing to leak
   data to unknown third parties.

 * If a particular cookie or other piece of browser
   state is discovered to be involved in tracking
   after it has already been set for some users,
   clean up existing copies in a way consistent
   with the user’s preferences, much as antivirus
   software regularly downloads updates for newly
   discovered malware.


Bringing it all together
========================

No one browser or extension has all of the pieces
today. Persistent users can put together a reasonable
protection toolkit with a little downloading and
configuration, but for mainstream adoption there is
room for a lot of development and testing.

The prize for success, though, is about much more
than saving the existing web advertising business from
ad blocking.  It's about leveling up web advertising
from a low-value medium that can't pay for new works,
to a higher-value medium that can.  For example,
[today it's hard for authors to earn money from short
fiction](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/12/cmap-short-stories-what-are-th.html)
because the high-revenue ad model of magazines
doesn't work on the web.  Cut out tracking, and the
data leakage, fraud, malware and loss of signal that
come with it, and it's a whole new web ad business.

While the ad blocking debate makes a lot of noise,
the real action is in improving the browser to enable
advertising to pull its weight&mdash;starting with
enforcing common-sense norms about user tracking.
