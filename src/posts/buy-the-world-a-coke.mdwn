Here's a TV commercial from 1971.

Aww.

But here on the Internet, at least a lot of the time,
people are more like, <q>I'd like to buy _my_ tribe
a Coke&reg; and the rest of the world can go die in
a fire.</q>

People have an us-and-them side and a
more inclusive side.  And advertising has
an unwritten rule about which side of the
customer you're allowed to talk to.  For a long
time brands have stuck with a kind of [generic
globalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YBtspm8j8M),
not enough to satisfy a bona fide social justice
warrior but never tied up with a specific tribe.
[Right-wing talk radio
in the USA has trouble keeping mainstream
advertisers](http://www.wsj.com/articles/talk-radios-advertising-problem-1423011395).
In one case, a blogger going by "Spocko" made
fair use recordings of some radio shows and raised
a stink to the advertisers.  [Despite some legal
threats](https://www.eff.org/cases/spocko-and-abc-ksfo),
it basically worked.  Most brands are
risk-averse enough to stay off talk radio.
Even on the web, it's news when a brand shows up
[sponsoring a beheading video on a jihadi
site](http://botlab.io/can-ddos-attacks-trigger-ads-and-generate-revenue/).

Do things work differently, though, when it's
an algorithm placing the ad in a niche that only
sympathizers can see?

>  The increasing polarization of news through social media allows liberals and conservatives to live in different versions of reality. And that’s making it harder and harder for our democratic system to function.

From BuzzFeed, [Hyperpartisan Facebook
Pages Are Publishing False And
Misleading Information At An Alarming
Rate](https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/partisan-fb-pages-analysis).

> The rapid growth of these pages combines with BuzzFeed News’ findings to suggest a troubling conclusion: The best way to attract and grow an audience for political content on the world’s biggest social network is to eschew factual reporting and instead play to partisan biases using false or misleading information that simply tells people what they want to hear. This approach has precursors in partisan print and television media, but has gained a new scale of distribution on Facebook.

Filter bubbling has been a thing for
political advertising for quite a while,
as [Zeynep Tufekci pointed out back in
2012](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html).
Campaigns can [target ethnic groups on Facebook with "voter suppression"](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-27/inside-the-trump-bunker-with-12-days-to-go), or share misleading messages
where they're 
[harder for outsiders to track down](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/politics/adtrack-signup.html?_r=0).

What happens after the election, when tribal
rage bubbles keep right on being a thing, but the
political ads dry up?  Are regular brand ads going
to get placed on fake news, scenes of violence or
threats of violence, and all the other us-versus-them
crap out there?  You probably wouldn't put
your brand on Stormfront, but will you put your
brand on one of the thousands of algorithmically
micromanaged mini-Stormfronts of Facebook? Are [dark
posts](https://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/facebook-dark-posts/)
the thing now?

This isn't a question about [whose politics match with
whose](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-24/peter-thiel-s-politics-become-a-deal-killer-in-silicon-valley),
or [whether or not Facebook enables
targeting using data that we would prefer to keep
private](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/01/facebook-target-mental-health-data-online_),
or [whether or not individuals should leave
Facebook](http://nickbriz.com/facebook/).
The question is whether brands are now getting comfortable
with working inside bubbles that would
not have previously been considered <q>brand-safe.</a>

People keep saying that <q>Google doesn't get
social</q>, but in a way, that's a compliment.
A lot of the time, people's idea of being social
is to split up into tribes and fling Internet poo,
or worse, at each other.  Part of <q>getting</q>
social is developing the ability to exploit
people's other-tribe-hating brain circuitry in the
same way that [spammers took advantage of open SMTP
relays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_mail_relay)
and [SilverPush took advantage of
an opportunity to sneakily connect mobile user
data](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/silverpush-ftc-stop-eavesdropping-with-audio-beacons).
(The [Peter Thiel
brouhaha](https://medium.com/@paulbiggar/why-would-facebook-fire-peter-thiel-bc389d5631d1#.rc9qcgn4t)
is raising the profile of the social
filter bubble issue by putting a human face
on it.  Every time Sanford Wallace's smug face
made the news in the 1990s, it motivated us to
fix up our mail servers and set up the early spam
filters.  Now it's Thiel in the news, making money
on both ends of the pipeline&mdash;recruiting [4GW
participants](http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2004/05/4gw_fourth_gene.html)
on Facebook, and selling Palantir
contracts to track them down later.  [Ingenious
patriotism](http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/IngPat.shtml)
at scale. So what to invent now?)

[Andy Warhol once said](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol):

> What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it. 

That was then. But today we're not even drinking the
same damn Coke.  I'm drinking the version [bottled in
Mexico](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-11/the-mexican-coca-cola-myth-its-almost-american).
Meanwhile, out in High Fructose Corn Syrup land,
they're drinking the other kind.

And that's just Coke.  Are economic inequality
and social distances between tribes getting
big enough that the idea of a brand-safe
ad placement is over?  Are brands just supposed to
[take](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/31/chick-fil-a-sales-2012_n_2590612.html)
[sides](http://www.advocate.com/print-issue/current-issue/2014/09/01/how-proud-proud-whopper)
now?  That's fine for fast food and soda pop, but what happens
when an [IT brand that benefits from economies of
scale](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11031910/donald-trump-apple-encryption-backdoor-statement)
has to pick a side?
