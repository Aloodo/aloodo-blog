The more 
[malvertising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvertising)
that comes out, the more that
<q>please turn off your ad blocker</q> messages on
web sites are starting to look irresponsible or
just plain scary.  Asking users to turn off the ad
blocker sounds like the web version of <q>If you
can't open lottery-winner-wire-transfer.zip,
turn off your antivirus.</q> Let's
have a look at a few recent malvertising examples.

These aren't skeevy ads on low-reputation pirate
sites.  Malvertising attacks are coming in on big-budget
sites such as AOL's Huffington Post, and included
in fake ads for real brands such as Hugo Boss.
They're using A-list adtech companies.  The [ongoing web ad fraud
problem](http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2014/12/what-every-ceo-needs-to-know-about.html)
is hitting users now, not just advertisers.
And so far the response from the ad networks has been a
few [whacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole)
at the problem accounts.  

[Users already trust web ads less than any other ad
medium.](http://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2015/03/02/connect-the-dots-between-unbridled-tracking-and-ad-blocking/)  Malvertising takes a form of advertising that's a 
[bad deal for the user](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#how-signaling-breaks-down) and makes it worse.
(If sewer rats are coming out of the commode, users
are going to put a brick on the lid.  If the rats
have rabies, make that two bricks.)

Ad blockers are a problem for ad-supported sites,
but having users run entirely unprotected
is worse.  When an ad medium is optimized
for direct response rates, it [loses value for brand
advertising](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#how-signaling-breaks-down).
Fortunately, new [tracking
protection](http://www.aloodo.org/protection/)
features and tools are a third alternative,
one that works for users, sites, and brands.
For users, tracking protection stops the
<q>creepy</q> ads that follow you from site to site.
For sites, tracking protection is a barrier to [data
leakage](http://www.naa.org/News-and-Media/Blog/data-leakage-newspapers.aspx).
For brand advertisers, tracking protection enables
signaling, not just automated cold calls.

Instead of unrealistic <q>turn off your ad blocker</q>
messages, or getting into a blocker vs. anti-blocker
fight that will just help the ad blockers improve
their update systems, or feeding the ["acceptable ads"
racket](http://www.themediabriefing.com/article/adblock-plus-google-microsoft-taboola-controversy),
sites can help promote tracking protection.

For example,
add a [tracking
test](http://www.aloodo.org/test/) to a site,
[replace confusing AdChoices links with a safer
alternative](/posts/safer-friendlier-adchoices/),
or encourage users to get protected by
offering some content behind a 
[reverse tracking wall](/posts/reverse-tracking-wall/).

Web advertising, so far,
is [much less valuable than print
advertising](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/).
Brands [need to replace print as the print audience
goes away](/posts/new-category/).  With tracking
protection, sites have
an opportunity to move out of commoditized direct
response advertising into valuable brand advertising.
