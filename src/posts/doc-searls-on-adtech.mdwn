_(Mailing list discussion between
[Doc Searls](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/)
and
[Don Marti](http://blog.aloodo.org/people/dmarti/),
formatted and edited for the web.  The original question was about the [SilverPush](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/beware-of-ads-that-use-inaudible-sound-to-link-your-phone-tv-tablet-and-pc/) tracking system.)_

Don: When a communications platform facilitates
surveillance marketing, it has a bug and needs to
be fixed.

Adtech and malware use many of the same
vulnerabilities, and even if all adtech companies
reform, or governments regulate them out of using
vulnerabilities, malware is still out there.
Platform developers have to fix the bugs, keep
hardening the platform to resist future ones, and
move on.  (The alternative is a 
[Peak Advertising](http://peakads.org/) effect, where a
targetable medium becomes less and less valuable for
advertising over time.)

**Doc: Can you differentiate adtech from what Google and Facebook do with their ad platforms? I’m getting questions about that lately, as all get lumped together, and ads on all are blocked by ad blockers.**

Adtech can have narrow or broad definitions.

The narrowest definition is a system that implements
the [Fundamental Value Proposition of Adtech as
defined by Michael
Tiffany](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#targeting-failure-legit-sites-lose-intermediarieswin):
diverting advertising money from high-value sites to
low-value sites by tracking users who visit both.

An economic definition of adtech would be any system
that relies on information about the user to reduce
the
[signaling](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#signaling)
value of an advertisement.

Google has search ads that have some adtech built in to
them, but could work without it and probably better.
 Some other Google ad products are pure adtech.

Facebook ads are pretty close to pure adtech.

**Tracking makes mountains of money for Facebook:
$4.5 billion in the last quarter. Not bad for a
system that trades off signaling value. (In fact
nearly all the advertising I see on Facebook is a
breed of spam. But maybe that’s me.)**

Facebook is as much an outlier in web advertising as
Apple is in hardware.

Facebook [takes up about 40 minutes per day](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-07-23/heres-how-much-time-people-spend-on-facebook-daily)
for the average person in
the USA.

Print newspapers are still around 14 minutes/day for
the average person in the USA. (Both averages include
non-users.)

Newspaper ads in this country are roughly as big a
business as Facebook advertising in total, worldwide. ([$16.4B in
2014](http://www.journalism.org/2015/04/29/newspapers-fact-sheet/)
).

Take the crappiest known ad medium on a per
user-minute basis—Facebook ads—multiply by an
insane number of user minutes, and you still get
real money.  But advertising that's only as valuable
as Facebook advertising isn't strong enough to support
news gathering and cultural works, the way that other
ad media are.

**Aside from that, I think the simplest definition
of adtech is surveillance-based advertising. Maybe
we should call it SBA.**

**I also think the difference with Google and Facebook
is that users of both know they’re being followed
and live with it (and, in some cases, like it) —
while adtech (or SBA) outside the obvious orbits of
both those companies has unknown provenance.**

That's what was so interesting about retargeting.
As soon as people started seeing ads "following them
around", reactions to the whole medium started to
[change](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2015/07/06/ad-blocking-why-now/),
most noticeably in ad blocking behavior.

The bigger question is: Why is surveillance marketing
even a thing?  Why do new exploit-based companies
like [SilverPush](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/beware-of-ads-that-use-inaudible-sound-to-link-your-phone-tv-tablet-and-pc/)
keep getting funded?

First, everyone on the Internet is inside some kind of filter bubble.  The more complexity and consensus found within the filter bubble, the less information can enter from outside.  (Windows NT and Unix were both difficult to keep working, so most of the people who were up to date on either were late to see Linux.  Today, Linux is complex, popular, and loud.)

The adtech scene is so complex and shares so many
assumptions that it's hard to consider alternatives.

**There needs to be a master list of those
assumptions. Or at least of the arcana involved.**

Writing down the hidden assumptions of surveillance
marketing would be like writing down the Bro Code (and
they're very similar.)  Start with the assumption that
marketers are experimenters, customers are subjects,
not that both sides are playing the same market game,
and go downhill from there.

Another problem is that
advertising is full of [Principal-agent
problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem).
Today's adtech ecosystem is structured to be a
win for ad agencies, which are at risk of being
disintermediated by the Internet.

Advertising is always in tension between "sell
products to customers" and "sell advertising to
clients."  It seems to have shifted further over to
the second, because user tracking makes it so easy
to generate mathematical-looking graphs.

**Numbers are crack. I was in the business and I’ve
seen it first hand. I even made money coming up with
an algorithm for factoring out seasonal variations
in radio station ratings, all the better to win bets
with buddies when each new “book” came out.**

**And the numbers today are so many more, and so
much more precise, and so much more intoxicating,
and so much prettier in PowerPoints. For an agency
to sell a company today on a truly creative and
signal-ful ad must be ridiculously hard. Though it can
happen. I thought [Volkswagen’s diesel test drive
ads](http://blog.caranddriver.com/vws-hilarious-new-tdi-diesel-ads-return-excellent-viral-mileage/)
were terrific.  (Alas, the company later shot itself
in the tires, but that’s a different matter.)**

Ad agencies won't give their own numbers away,
but some will have an advantage when some of the
surveillence marketing numbers stop working and other
kinds of data collection become more important. (The
big opportunity for [VRM](https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/)
comes as soon as Marketing
realizes that fair trade data is easier and/or more
accurate than surveillance-derived data. Making
surveillance harder, less accurate, and more expensive
pushes the balance towards VRM).

Finally, Internet people were slothful in fixing
early bugs that enabled the current generation of
surveillance marketing, and we aren't clearly sending
a message to investors (who should be scared off by
the prospect of investing in a known software bug)
that we're going to do better in future.

**What are those, exactly, and can they still be
fixed?**

Any time a browser allows for fingerprinting or
tracking, it's a bug.  [Mozilla tracks fingerprinting
bugs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Fingerprinting), and the 
[Tor browser depends on it](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting-linkability).

The bugs will never _all_ be fixed&mdash;software is
hard and browsers keep getting new, potentially
fingerprintable, functionality&mdash;but we can reduce
the expected returns on surveillance marketing
investments, and increase the returns on positive-sum
investments, by reducing the time that any given bug
remains open.

The good news is that the best browser for
security and privacy is also the best browser for
legit business.  I don't agree with most of what
the retro, anti-digital, old-school ad people
are saying.  "Big Data" could be much, much more
useful for everybody, if people would only stop
thinking of it as a way to automate the [carny
trick of putting chalk marks on audience members'
backs](http://www.heyrubecircus.com/fun-facts/origins-of-the-carnie-lingo-mark/)
and put it to uses that people agree on and don’t
have to be hidden or made confusing.  (Clicking “I
agree" is not agreeing.)

**Ya still gotta like the likes of [Why I
Lied](http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2015/11/why-i-lied.html)
by [Bob Hoffman the Ad
Contrarian](http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/).**

Sure, but fixing tracking does not have to mean taking
a step backward in technology.

IMHO, creative ad people and creative web people
could have an _awesome_ conference if we managed
to exclude all surveillance marketing from it.

Is advertising ruining the web? Is the web ruining
advertising? No way. [Web people who think that
"advertising" is creepy are just as mixed up as
advertising people who think that "the web" is
creepy.](http://zgp.org/~dmarti/business/fresh-start/)

Every set of new technologies has the obvious, "hey we
could do THIS with it" application, and surveillance
marketing is the one that a lot of people have come
up with for the Internet.   But once we can get
past it&mdash;and make the net more trustworthy for
more people—there are better opportunities.

Publishers complain about ad blocking, but that's
only a tiny part of the problem.  The real loss
to advertising on the Internet is that users have
mentally marked down the value of an ad online to
the value of spam.

[Newspapers: Fact Sheet By Michael
Barthel](http://www.journalism.org/2015/04/29/newspapers-fact-sheet/)

The same news stories can bring in more ad revenue in
a low-tracking medium, print, than in a high-tracking
medium, the web. 

Fixing the bugs that enable surveillance marketing is
a way to build a more valuable ad medium.  Web sites
and ad agencies can get a head start now.  [It's easy
to get started.](http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/howto/)
