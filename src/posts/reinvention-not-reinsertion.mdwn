In this week's ad blocking news, the Adblock Plus
people are all butthurt that Facebook is reinserting
ads by editing HTML instead of [paying for
whitelisting](https://www.engadget.com/2016/02/12/rip-adblock-plus/).
I'm not sure who's winning right now, but by the time
I put this up the current state of the "cat and mouse
game" (when have you ever seen a mouse buy stuff from
a cat?) will be different.  So go follow [Lara
O'Reilly](http://www.businessinsider.com/author/lara-oreilly)
and [Jack
Marshall](http://topics.wsj.com/person/M/jack-marshall/7969)
in your news recommendation tool of choice if you
really want to keep up.

Anyway, the web advertising debate is about Adblock
Plus the way that the online music debate was about
Napster.  Can we turn down the long-playing drama
and pay attention to the important stuff here,
for 23 minutes and 36 seconds at least?  What will
web advertising look like when the ad blocker fades
into the background, the way that spam filters are
a background concern for email newsletter senders?

[Dr. Johnny Ryan, speaking at the Advertising Research
Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8qlyXQUnfw)
(watch the whole thing) has a good part of the answer.

It's not just the user's rights.
When an ad medium makes it harder to
target individual users, it gets better at
[signaling](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#signaling).
[Context
matters](http://www.slideshare.net/IanGibbs2/guardian-guide-to-context-research-2015).
There's no free lunch.
[Everything we know about how ads work in
context](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#evidence-for-the-signaling-model)
tells us that the average web user is a pretty good
applied behavioral economist.

That's where reinvention, not reinsertion, comes in.
What does web advertising look like when it works
_with_ the user's mental "reputation coprocessor" and
not against it?  When advertising turns into a game
that you can win with a sustained signal of quality,
not with targeting tricks that have to change every
time the users figure them out?
