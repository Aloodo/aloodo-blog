[Doc Searls](https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/), on
Twitter, links to some [predictions for the future of
marketing](http://www.tintup.com/blog/future-of-advertising-and-marketing/).

If you read that, it looks like the future will
be...basically, copied from a white paper about
retargeting.

Yawn slash eeew.

You can't just predict that the future is like today
but more so.  That would have gotten us "interactive
TV" instead of the Web.

I'm not going to predict the future of Marketing in
general, but since there's a lot of attention to one
corner of it, here goes.


**Consolidation.** I don’t know if we’ll
get all the way down to a two-logo Lumascape,
but single digits, maybe. Two-sided markets
tend to consolidate, because buyers go where
the sellers are and vice versa. This isn’t
happening in web advertising, because agencies
have an interest in artificially complicating the
online ad business, and venture capitalists have
funded a lot of competing, minimally different,
startups that will take time to settle out. But
with more scrutiny on agencies because of the [rebates
problem](http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2016/06/ana-report-disgrace-4as-response-joke.html),
and less incoming
[VC](https://aleph.vc/a-call-to-israeli-engineers-adtech-is-not-for-you-b1f0171a867f#.pigdff9eb)
money to adtech, it will be easier to see the
consolidation happening.

**More and harder math.** As complicated as the
math in online ads is now, it’s about to get more
interesting and potentially way more important. Right
now, online advertisers are playing a relatively
simple **level zero** game of maximizing response rate
given the available ability to target users in each
medium. The next step is the **level one** game where
brands and publishers re-shape the medium (and the
ability of users to control it) in order to adjust
how well the medium’s users can be targeted by a
brand and its competitors.

An ad medium that facilitates collection of
information from the user also limits transfer of
information to the user, which is necessary for brand
building ([There’s no free lunch](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#how-signaling-breaks-down)).  Brands
and publishers will need to adjust the balance of
targetability and signal-carrying ability. That means
that over the next several years, advertisers will
have to solve **level one** problems in the areas of
Behavioral Economics and Signaling.

**More memorable ads.** As a user, right now you’re
seeing a lot of crappy ads, because the problem of
measuring immediate response to a terrible ad is
easier than the problem of measuring Brand Equity
changes as the result of a signal-carrying ad. The
terrible ad problem is temporary. Advertising is not
a zero-sum struggle with math and technology on one
side, and creative on the other. Better math will
have the side effect of informing and justifying
better creative.

**Ad blockers fade to the background.** Right now,
the ad blocker is a threat to legit ads because
new blocking development is sustained by the
paid whitelisting model and because high-value and
low-value ads are delivered the same way. High-value
ads will beat ad blocking, possibly with a combination
of

 * legal and regulatory attacks on paid whitelisting

 * front-ending the CMS with a proxy server that stitches ads into place and obfuscates IDs and classes

 * limiting third-party tracking that facilitates low-value and fraudulent ads

Ad blockers (and other privacy tools, as a side
effect) will still catch the crap ads. And advertisers
will still have to consider ad blocking, but in the
background, much as email newsletter senders  have to
consider the spam filter.  Go watch that [Johnny Ryan
