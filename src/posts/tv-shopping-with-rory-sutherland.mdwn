Here's a great podcast episode: [Ogilvy and Mather
UK vice-chairman Rory Sutherland, on the Echo Chamber
podcast](http://www.holmesreport.com/latest/podcast/article/podcast-rory-sutherland-on-behavioural-science-big-data-trump-brexit-more).
Includes a lot of topics, including the problem of
how to shop for a TV.

That's a hard problem.  TVs are complex, hardly
anyone buys the same kind twice, the market may
contain deceptive sellers, and shoppers have limited
decision-making time.  Sutherland can't afford to
become perfectly well-informed about every available
TV in order to make the buying decision that _Homo
economicus_ would.  He has to make a satisfactory
decision with limited information.


## Brand advertising solves a problem.

How does Sutherland manage to buy a TV when
he doesn't have time to learn much about TVs?
The same way most people do, by using our 
existing human-reputation-evaluating wetware.
"We solve the easier problem, which is can I trust
the person selling it," he says.

It would be costly for a company that already has
brand equity, such as Sony or Panasonic, to sell a
bad product.  A company selling crappy TVs under
a low-value brand name can easily [spend $5 on a new

when people catch on, but a
company with an established brand would be taking a
bigger risk. Sutherland says,

> We interpret the significance of a message not only by the information it ostensibly contains, but by the cost in terms of effort and expense that has gone into the creation of that message, and also by the cost consequent on the sender if that message is wrong.

Listen to the whole thing. 

You're back?  Good.  I know that the podcast covered
a lot of topics, but I'm going to dig into the TV
shopping part a little bit more.


## What does a reputable brand need from an advertising medium?

Low-reputation and high-reputation sellers need
fundamentally different qualities from an advertising
medium.

 * Low-reputation sellers need to split the audience into small groups in order to deceive the uninformed while escaping the attention of [those who seek to build their own reputations by enforcing norms](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/03/punishment_and_.html).

 * High-reputation sellers need to send a costly, hard-to-repudiate signal to an large audience that includes low-information shoppers and well-informed recommenders and norm enforcers.

With today's web advertising, sellers have the ability
to target but not the ability to signal. Web
ads therefore meet the needs of low-reputation
sellers very well, but are inadequate for the
needs of high-reputation sellers.  A recent
[meeting at PageFair on the subject of fixing web ads](https://blog.pagefair.com/2016/four-big-ideas-emerge-from-pagefair-global-stakeholder-roundtable/)
came up with this:

> Use of contextual targeting to establish ad relevance should be increased. This will end the over-reliance on behavioral tracking of users.

That's a good start, but it doesn't solve the problem
for brands that are working on [building brand
equity](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/bike-helmets/).
If, when a user sees an ad, that ad _could_ have been
targeted to him or her, it's worthless for signaling. Remember,
we're all pretty good applied behavioral economists
here.  We can tell a high-signal ad medium from a
low-signal one because we can [see where ads can
"follow us around"](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2015/07/06/ad-blocking-why-now/).

As [Bob Hoffman's refrigerator
test](http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2015/05/take-refrigerator-test.html)
shows, brand equity isn't built on the web.  This is not just
a concern for web publishers that want a piece of
the market for high-value advertising.  It's also
a problem for brands that need to be able to move
signal-carrying ads to the web
as [print advertising goes away](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#fig1).


## Tracking protection for brand advertisers

Instead of simply
relying on the web medium to [slowly fix
itself](http://adzerk.com/blog/2015/09/adzerk-joins-electronic-frontier-foundation-do-not-track-coalition-adopts-privacy-standard/),
high-reputation sellers can now experiment with
tracking protection campaigns in order to give signaling
power to advertising on the web.
When a web visitor comes to check out the specs
of a TV, test if the browser is vulnerable
to third-party targeting.  ([There are easy
ways to do this with a script included on a
page](http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/howto/).)
Offer unprotected users a chance to get protected
by installing or turning on some kind of 
[tracking protection](http://www.aloodo.org/protection/).

Now you're communicating with a tracking-protected
user for whom the web works as a signal-carrying
medium&mdash;a user who's no longer in the pool of
commodity eyeballs being offered to deceptive sellers.
Besides electronics, other high-reputation categories
that are potential good fits for tracking protection
include:

 * Insurance and other financial services

 * Health care

 * Hotels

With tracking protection, a brand's audience can see
signal-carrying ads, like the [Canvas ads on The Next
Web](http://thenextweb.com/voice/2015/05/07/whats-the-deal-with-tnws-new-canvas-ads/),
without the targeting-based low-value ads that
tend to devalue the medium.  I'll save a spot on my
refrigerator shelf for a brand that can build its
reputation with a tracking protection campaign and
pass the refrigerator test.

Look for goods that are difficult to evaluate at point
of purchase and where an experience with a deceptive
seller can be costly, and you'll find a client for a
tracking protection campaign.  Shoppers are usually
much better at applied behavioral economics than
marketers give them credit for.  Tracking protection
is a way to make a better-informed, better-signaled-to
audience work for brands.
