Users say that they're blocking ads because
of the annoyance. But ad blocking has only
recently started to catch on, and ad annoyance
has been there since the beginning. Distracting
blinky ads, slow page load times, security
concerns, the whole enchilada.  For many users,
web ads in the days of dial-up connections and [pop-up
windows](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/?single_page=true)
were even more annoying than the web ads of today.

The ease of use of ad blocking hasn't
changed either.  Free, convenient ad blockers
have been available for more than a decade. But
[WebWasher](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,86574,00.asp),
[AdSubtract](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,14046,00.asp)
and others earned good reviews, then failed to
catch on.

Today, though, ad blocking is a thing.  And that's
not so much because new reasons to block ads are
appearing, but because reasons not to block are
going away.

 * The red line, <q>retargeting</q>, is a query for a
form of targeted advertising that is easily visible

them around.</q>

 * The blue line is a query for <q>how to block
ads</q>.  Users looking for a solution.

Why does the blue line start to take off only after the
red line?  Web ads were just as annoying before
users started to see how they were targeted.
What is it about _targeted_ ads that changed the
decision to block?  Why was the 2010 [What They
Know series in the Wall Street Journal such a big
deal](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2010/07/31/the-data-bubble/)?

Is better targeting causing blocking, or is it just
an accidental correlation?  Survey data suggests
that users react differently to ads depending
on how accurately they are targeted.  In [one
study](http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1138&context=asc_papers),
66% of adult Americans said they <q>do not want
marketers to tailor advertisements to their
interests</q>  And when the researchers explained
how adtech can target ads to them, the percentage
saying they don't want targeting went up&mdash;as
high as 80%.

If you don't believe academic studies, believe the
company with the best marketing in the world. Would
Apple really put this copy on the [Safari browser
page](https://www.apple.com/safari/)...

> The web pages you visit often leave cookies from third-party websites. These cookies can be used to track where you go on the web, target you with ads, or create a profile of your online activities. Safari was the first browser to block these cookies by default.

...if it didn't resonate with users?  If users like

feature _extra_ tracking, to help users <q>connect and
share with brands.</q>

Are ad blocker users irrationally squicked-out by
targeting that's actually good for them?  And are
users just being dishonest by using web content
without accepting the ads?

## Fair is fair: advertising and the reciprocity norm 

It turns out that ad blocker users are pretty good at
applied behavioral economics.  If we understand
what the basic bargain behind advertising is, we can
understand why people [put up with advertising in some
media](http://digiday.com/agencies/the-ad-contrarians-digital-reality-check/)
but block it in others.

That's one kind of fair exchange.  It's the **lead
generation bargain**.  Fill out this form to WATCH
OUR FREE WEBINAR!  People choose to reveal personal
info all the time, every time they enter a sweepstakes
or swipe a supermarket loyalty card.

But are users _passively_ choosing to share data with
unknown third parties?  (Quick, name three companies
that ran trackers on the last news story you read,
and what they do with your data.)  Studies [suggest
otherwise](http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/03/09/main-findings-11/).

But advertising isn't just about the lead generation bargain.
Lead generation can send a special offer to buy a
product for a lower price...

<img alt="Beacons beam rich-media mobile
messages to passers-by: 80% OFF"
width="100%" src="/images/80-percent.jpeg">

...but it can't build a brand that people will be happy
to pay a _higher_ price for.  That's where signaling
comes in.

Clearly lead generation is not the point of high-value
old-school ad media such as TV, radio, and print.
Nobody gives up any personal data to watch [Knight
Rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Rider_%281982_TV_series%29)
on broadcast TV, or buy a copy of
the newspaper out of a vending machine.  But that
[impersonal](http://richardstacy.com/2012/08/30/the-great-thing-about-advertising-is-that-no-one-takes-it-personally/)
advertising is where the money is. Print is trending
down but [still more valuable than either web or
mobile](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#fig1)
on a per user minute basis.

The bargain that matters in
advertising's big leagues is the exchange of
[signal](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#signaling)
for a user's attention.  An ad can be a public,
credible, costly [display of the advertiser's
intentions in the market](http://www.dotcoma.it/2015/06/22/the-problem-with-targeting.html).  When an ad fails to send a signal, as
is the case when it's targeted to a user who
can't tell if it's part of a big campaign or just the
digital version of a cold call, the ad doesn't hold up
its end of the **signal-for-attention bargain**, and
the user starts looking for an opportunity to block it.

One way to look at the blocking problem is to
accuse ad blocker users of violating a reciprocity
norm, by entering into an implied lead generation
bargain and then failing to hold up their end.
But the other, more valuable deal&mdash;the
signal-for-attention bargain&mdash;is the one that
advertisers broke first.


How to stick to both bargains?
------------------------------

One important direction
is to make the lead generation bargain
[explicit](http://adage.com/article/datadriven-marketing/brands-transparency-iot-data-tracking-study/299290/),
not sneaky.  Instead of using malware-like third-party
tracking techniques, make it easier for users to
[control](https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/about/)
how they share their info.

The other half is of the solution is to
restore the signal-for-attention bargain.
Some of the most promising new work from
web browser developers holds the promise
of changing the web advertising game to work
more like signal-carrying print and broadcast media.
[Firefox](http://monica-at-mozilla.blogspot.com/2015/05/tracking-protection-for-firefox-at-web.html)
and [Apple
Safari](https://www.webkit.org/blog/3476/content-blockers-first-look/)
have tracking protection functionality in progress,
and [Microsoft Internet Explorer has had it for a
while](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/products/ie-9/features/tracking-protection).

Tracking protection can displace ad blockers by
filling users' immediate need to block the low-value
targeted ads that <q>follow</q> them, while at the
same time leaving the door open for signal-carrying
advertising that works better for brands and pays
better for publishers.

Web publishers today have a choice: get dragged into a
no-win game of blocking vs. anti-blocking, or change
the conversation and offer users an alternative that
works better for everyone.  Instead of just lecturing
users to <q>turn off your ad blocker,</q> it's time
to encourage them to enable tracking protection,
and turn on the signal.
