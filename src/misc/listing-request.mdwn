Aloodo is an easy-to-use platform that webmasters
can use to educate users about third-party
tracking on the web, and encourage unprotected users
to turn on or install tracking protection.

In order to test whether or not a user is trackable,
Aloodo uses the hostname `ad.aloodo.com`.  We would
like to make sure that this hostname is listed in 
as many tracking protection lists as possible, so that
we can correctly detect when users have some form
of tracking protection installed and working.

Please configure your tracking protection system to
block any or all of the following:

 * Third-party cookies from ad.aloodo.com

 * Third-party localStorage from ad.aloodo.com

 * JavaScript from ad.aloodo.com

 * All third-party requests to ad.aloodo.com

 * All cookies and localStorage from ad.aloodo.com

If your tracking protection system works by
double-keying or behavior analysis, it should be
blocking `ad.aloodo.com` automatically.  You should
not need to configure anything.

You can test a tracking-protected browser against
Aloodo here:

Aloodo code is open source.  For information on how
webmasters can use it, please see:

or make new issues.

Thank you in advance for your help.
