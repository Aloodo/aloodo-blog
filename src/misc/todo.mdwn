Test more [predictions from Targeted Advertising Considered
Harmful](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#am-i-right-testable-predictions)

 * survey tracking-protected users: how much do they
   spend online?

 * survey tracking-protected users: are they more or
   less likely to buy large items such as vehicles
   and financial products online?

 * survey tracking-protected users with basic factual
   questions on how tracking and targeting work.  Are
   better-informed users more likely to be protected?


Add features to [tracking protection
test](http://www.aloodo.org/test/)

 * Detect
 [X-UIDH](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/verizon-x-uidh)

 * Detect DNT, warn about <q>naked DNT</q> without
   tracking protection.

 * User survey on final page: is this result what you
   expected?

 * Custom versions of intermediate pages, for tests
   on other sites

 * Document how the test works, in order to coordinate
   with behavior-based tracking protection developers.
   **(in progress)**

Tracking protection requests pending

 * Blur

 * Ghostery


Other software

 * Mobile apps to test <q>Advertising ID</q> and remind
   user to reset it if stale.  (Android apps can apparently read
   the Ad ID even if `limitAdTrackingEnabled` is true:
   [AdvertisingIdClient.Info](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/identifier/AdvertisingIdClient.Info.html), so
   churning the Ad ID is probably a better solution
   than selecting <q>limit tracking</q>.)


Organization

 * Basic meta stuff for new online advertising
   organization **(in progress)**

 * Recruit board, advisory board, tech committee,
   corporate members **(in progress)**

 * More web articles


Informational

 * Wiki directory of reported tracking hosts (with
   tools to import/export common protection list
   formats)

 * tracking protection campaign for one town (<q>Like
   Google Fiber for online marketing</q>)

 * Slide deck with good photos, charts
