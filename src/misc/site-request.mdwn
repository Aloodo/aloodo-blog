A long-lived Internet bug is spreading malware,
enabling fraud, and taking financial support away
from important cultural goods.  I'm writing to ask
you, as the maintainer of an independent web site,
to take a few minutes to help fix it.

The bug I'm talking about is the problem of
third-party user tracking. It's left over from
some quick-and-dirty web security decisions
of the 1990s.  When users can be tracked from
site to site, most of the value created by
web advertising is shifted [away from sites and
users](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/signaling/), and
toward criminals and companies that collect user data.

Surveillance marketing, such as <q>behavioral</q> and
<q>retargeted</q> advertising that appears to follow
users from site to site, has negative externalities.
The costs of malware, data leakage and identity
theft are paid by the people whose information is
compromised, not by the companies that choose to
collect personal data.

Even if you, as an individual web expert, are able
to install and use tools to protect yourself, your site
will do better when you can help protect others. Every
minute and every dollar that your web site visitors
lose to surveillance marketing is a minute or a dollar
that can't go to support creative activity on the web.


How an independent site can help
--------------------------------

The good news is that the tracking protection tools
we need to fix the problem are already available,
and improving every day. Users just need to
turn them on.  Your site can inform, nudge, or
reward each user to turn on or install a [tracking
protection](http://www.aloodo.org/protection/) tool
that works for his or her own browser.  Every time a
user gets protected, the web works a little better.
Tracking protection discourages the forms of
advertising that have negative externalities, and
helps shift ad budgets to ads that have positive
externalities.

If you are already running ads on your site, and
are concerned about ad blocking by users, offer them
tracking protection as an alternative.  Tracking
protection helps stop the 
<q>creepy</q>-looking and malware-carrying
ads that [motivate users to run ad
blockers](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/turn-off-your-ad-blocker/).

Without protection,
an advertiser can take advantage of [data
leakage](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/#targeting-failure-legit-sites-lose-intermediarieswin)
to track users away from your site and
reach them elsewhere&mdash;which often results in
supporting malware
and deceptive sites.  With tracking
protection, those low-quality ad impressions disappear
from the market, pushing up the value of high-quality
ads.


One line of JavaScript
----------------------

The simplest way to help is to add the Aloodo script
to your site.

	<script src="https://ad.aloodo.com/ad.js"></script>

It will pop up a tracking warning when it detects
that a visitor is unprotected.  (Different tracking
protection systems work in different ways, so a user
has to visit several sites that include the script
in order to get a warning.)

Users who are already protected from tracking will
not experience any increase in page load times or
other changes.  The ad.aloodo.com site is already
blocked by the popular tracking protection lists.


See it in action
----------------

The simplest way to see a tracking warning is to
start up an unprotected browser and:

1. Take a [tracking protection
test](http://www.aloodo.org/test/), so that the system
can figure out that your browser can be tracked from
site to site.

2. Visit a [page with the script already
installed](http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/).
You should see a warning.


Warnings in your own words
--------------------------

If you want a customized warning,
like the one on the [Aloodo.org privacy
page](http://www.aloodo.org/privacy/), you can add
the script and make any HTML element with an id of
`tracking-warning-block` or `tracking-warning-inline`
and a style of `display: none`.   The script will show
your warning (change display to `block` or `inline`)
instead of adding the default warning.

A [minimal one-line warning](/posts/mini-warning/)
is easy to cut and paste onto any page or template.
[More detailed info on custom warnings](/misc/howto/)
is also available.

The [Aloodo home page](http://www.aloodo.org/) has
an example of a fixed-position warning that stays in
place as the page scrolls. (It won't show up unless
the system can see that you're trackable, as happens
when you fail the tracking test.)


Conclusion
----------

Aloodo is an easy-to-use platform that webmasters
can use to educate users about third-party tracking
on the web, and encourage unprotected users to turn
on or install tracking protection.

Aloodo code is open source.  You are welcome to
fork, clone, send pull requests, or make new issues.
Or use all or part of it to make your own system to
help your users get protected.

Whether or not your site carries advertising, **some
forms of advertising have positive externalities that
are good for you.**  When you read an anthology of
short stories collected from old magazines, or watch
old episodes of TV shows, you benefit from the power
of advertising to support cultural goods.

We can make web ads work more like the magazine
ads that support quality content, and less like
direct mail.

Thank you in advance for your help.
